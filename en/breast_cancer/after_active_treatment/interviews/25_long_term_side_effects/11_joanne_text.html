		Troubling long-term effects of treatment

		<p>So I think I got in the place that I was blaming the drugs and the chemo and the treatment. I was comfort eating or changing my lifestyle because I didn’t care for a while. Nobody really pointed that out. So it took a surgeon to really smack me in the face with it. Then I started again, that’s when I started getting in shape again, trying to get in shape and eat healthier. I read all the book that help to prevent cancer and just try to go back to what I needed to do to get healthy. And then I realized that I had to change my lifestyle. It wasn’t going to be… treatment is over, cancer is over and you can go back to work and act if nothing ever happened.
