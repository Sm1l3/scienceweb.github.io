        <p><strong>Ginette</strong>: A white porridge because I couldn’t eat anything else because of my mouth. This and Ensure. So when you have this in front of you, you lean there and look at it and you say: “Well, if you want to survive, eat! Even if you don’t feel like it, eat!” It’s not pleasant, so… Janine was trying to put a little bit of fruits, a fruit that I would like, but you know that it is tofu with yogurt.</p>
        <p><strong>Janine</strong>: Tofu, full fat milk, yogurt, wheat bran, peach or pear because these fruits were the smoothest one for her tongue.</p>
        <p><strong>Ginette</strong>: It was the nutritionist…</p>
        <p><strong>Janine</strong>: I had to do it thick enough, but liquid enough to go through a straw. So it was…</p>
        <p><strong>Ginette</strong>: It was the nutritionist that I had…</p>
        <p><strong>Janine</strong>: It was a porridge.</p>
        <p><strong>Ginette</strong>: Porridge, porridge! A nutritionist that I had to see because I had lost… for sure 30 to 40 pounds.</p>
        <p><strong>Janine</strong>: In few weeks…</p>
        <p><strong>Ginette</strong>: In few weeks. So I was telling myself: “You cannot continue like this. You must eat something.” And she was asking me what I was eating. Of course I was not eating, I was taking bottles of Ensure, but it was not sustaining me. So she gave us this diet that went on for many months.</p>
