		<p>I’m not the same person that I was before I had cancer, so I know it puts a heck of a strain on your body. I don’t think you recover from that. You recover from the cancer but not the stress and strain that was on your body because I’m not the same. I’m older, of course, but I don’t think that did me any good having that. I put weight on because I wasn’t doing what I normally do; dancing and everything else. It certainly slowed me down. I’m still running around doing... I’m in the drama group, I’m in the line dancing, I’m in the gardening club, I’m in all of that but not as much. I used to like to travel and camp and everything, I don’t care for that now. But yeah I wouldn’t recommend it to anybody.</p>
