		<p>It could come back. I do think about it. You can’t, now things are different. Before when something was wrong with me I’d go "Ah it’s fine it’s nothing." Now something’s wrong with me I go to the doctor right away and I’m like "What’s this thing." I had a mole removed, I would have never, again, I have a mole who cares, and now I’m paranoid.  I react immediately. It’s... which might be a good thing because then they’ll find out if something’s wrong with me but they can’t tell you. They can’t actually tell you don’t have cancer anymore. They don’t know. The only way that they can really know is if you have blood cancer, because they can take the blood out and test the blood. But with tumours, they got to find them first and then biopsy them. It doesn’t work that way. I’m really worried about recurrence, I don’t know what to do if that happens to me, well one slice of salami at a time. Right now, I’m alive and I’m doing whatever I want and I’m going to party and work and pretend... you can’t control the future, something else bad could happen to you.</p>
