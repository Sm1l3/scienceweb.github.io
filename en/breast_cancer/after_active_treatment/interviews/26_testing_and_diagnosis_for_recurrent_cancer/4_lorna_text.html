		<p>I had a really bad cold all winter in my sinuses and I was almost convinced myself that it had to be cancer... because how can you not? Especially when they kept track of you for so close, for so long. I think everybody I’ve talked to, that’s gone through it thinks like that. Right away that’s what it is. And, of course a lot of our friends have cancer in different areas too... so you try not to, you try not to dwell on that my goodness.
