		<p>Every week I had to go to the hospital or every second week and see the cancer doctor. Every week I would go, he would say to me "Gaye, you know you’re really high risk to reoccur." And I told him, after about the second time, that I didn’t want him to tell me that again. He’s told me once, I know that and I would, if it happened, I would deal with it then. And I told him that I could walk out of this hospital and get hit by a car as well and so I wasn’t going to worry. I’m not going to worry about whether or not I get cancer again. As much as I don’t want to get it, I’ll deal with it if it happens. </p>
