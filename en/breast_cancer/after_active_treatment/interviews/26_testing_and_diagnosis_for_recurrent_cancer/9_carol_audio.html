		<p>I think for me, also, the scary thing is that I have to be followed closely for 10 years. That means, my chances of having it again for 10 years are elevated. That’s, that’s scary, that’s scary, it means it’s not really over when the chemo and the radiation is over. You still, every year that you get tested, it’s going to be scary and my kids are young still, and that’s hard ...  </p>
        <p>But there’s knowing in your head, but always at the back of my mind is the fact that it’s 10 years that I have to be followed. And when it comes, if it comes back, it’s usually worse. So even knowing how successful they are at counteracting and fighting breast cancer, I’m still scared at the back of my mind that it’ll come back. I think I’ll be scared for 10 years. </p>
