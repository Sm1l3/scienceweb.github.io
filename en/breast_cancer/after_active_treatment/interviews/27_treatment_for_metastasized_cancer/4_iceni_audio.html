		<p>Yes, I thought they should have taken my breast the first time, that’s what I thought. I thought "Bloody hell!" That’s what I thought, if they’d only... because I was prepared for them to take my breast. I thought I would lose my breast, I was all prepared. The second time I wasn’t prepared, I was more upset. I thought "Oh it’s come back." I thought they’d just take another lump out but they said we’re going to take the whole thing and under my arm and everything else. So yes, I was mad about that.</p>
        <p>I was pissed off to be honest, that if they’d only bloody well done that first. And it was shocking that I did get cancer again and then to think I had to lose it again, I thought "Gees!" So yes, I was more upset the second time.</p>
