<h1><strong>Work and finances</strong></h1>

<p>The women we interviewed spoke about the impact that breast cancer had on their work and careers as well as on their personal finances. In this page you can read about the extent to which they experienced support at work, the financial implications of having cancer, returning to work during or after treatment and the overall impact on their lives. </p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Support at work</h2>
<p>Women who experienced strong support from colleagues throughout their illness were appreciative of their reactions.</p>

	</div>
	<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>Women described colleagues that called them at home, sent cards, and Amanda even received a handmade quilt from her boss. Carol's colleagues provided home cooked meals. Jeanette, who worked in the service industry, received support from customers who noticed her baldness and shared their stories with her. Amanda received great help from a colleague to organize her leave through administration. </p>

<p>Telling colleagues about the diagnosis was usually a challenge and colleagues were often shocked or upset after learning about the diagnosis. </p>

<p>Donna described how  her "heart cracked wide open with the illness" after she was diagnosed. Not all women we spoke to felt that they received as much support as they might have wanted.</p>

<h2>Taking time off</h2>


<p>Most women going through chemotherapy took time off from work – from several weeks to, more often, 1 to 2 years. Women that underwent radiation therapy or surgery were sometimes able to work throughout and others took only a few weeks off or reduced their working hours. These decisions or situations were highly dependent on the individual circumstances of each woman and her illness, including factors such as the severity of the disease, treatments, the extent of insurance coverage, number of available days of sick leave, and support from colleagues, family, and friends, and the nature of their work. Kathryn has been on sick leave for 11 years ever since she was diagnosed with metastasized breast cancer.  She said "There's nobody there to tell you how you're going to feel about not being able to go back to work, about how shitty you're going to feel."</p>

<p>Several women combined work and chemotherapy. Some found it helpful to work but most found that they needed to adapt their work schedule to take time to heal or rest. Donna initially expected to be able to continue working but then used up her available sick time. Her boss told her just to take the time she needed and it would be all figured out. Melissa, who took a few days off for each chemotherapy session now thinks it would have been better if she had given herself more time to heal.  Nadia (B) managed to work throughout her radiation treatment and said: "Everybody told me after the second week of radiation, 'you will not be able to go work' but I did it and I am very proud of myself."</p>

</div>
<div class="clear"></div>

<p>A few women, such as Jeanette and Samantha, said work was a helpful distraction and provided some social support, while Shelley felt that the routine of work, life and home life helped her recover. </p>
<p>Amanda found it helpful to be off work in order to prepare for her surgery, although she was surprised how easily she was able to stop work from one day to the next. Melissa took 5 weeks off after finishing treatment and felt the time was helpful to recuperate and to spend time with her family. Sirkka felt too sick and weak to go to work and took time off. Kathryn, a teacher, hadn't realized how stressful her job was until she took the time off, and felt blessed to be off.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Impact on career</h2>

<p>Even though most women eventually returned to the same position, some talked about the negative impact breast cancer had on their working life. Amanda was excited about starting a new job but had to leave that position. Nalie could not return to her job after her sick leave and found it difficult to be 25 years old and unemployed because of her illness after imagining a more stable life and career. Naoual returned for a little while but was unable to continue working. </p>

<div class="clear"></div>
<p>Isla said: "I think employers can be sensitive to that try to keep ways for women to be in the workforce during this (treatment)."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Finances</h2>
<p>Things such as having long and short-term disability plans, unused sick leave, being retired, available emergency financial aid programs, and good medical coverage limited the financial consequences for some. But, other women described longer periods without pay as they only had limited sick leave or had to wait before sick leave was being paid.  Iceni, for example, spent all her savings as she did not want to go on welfare and had to return to work while she was still not well. </p>


<div class="purpleBox">
	<a style="float:left;"><img src="../profile/100x100/28_Christine.jpg" /></a>
	<div class="purpleBoxContainer">
		<div class="purpleBoxContent">
	Thanks to her partner's employer, Christine had good medical coverage but would only receive long-term disability after 2 years. Additional costs such as parking were having an impact.
		</div>
		<a href="javascript:shadowPopup('',922,630, 'interviews/14_impact_on_work_and_finances/6_christine.html'); void(0);"><span style="font-size:14px"> »</span> Watch</a>

	<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>The additional costs associated with things like travel and parking for appointments, treatments or medications not fully covered by provincial health programs, or for wigs or specialized bras were substantial. Some women were not able to afford these extra expenses. Iceni, for example, decided to make her own bras and Annie travelled over an hour by bus for every treatment and appointment – she could not afford other means of transport. Iceni felt that people should be offered parking vouchers.  Young women in certain provinces had to make additional expenses if they decided they wanted to undergo a treatment to freeze eggs as chemotherapy can affect women's fertility. You can read more about this in <a href="preserving_fertility.html"> preserving fertility</a>.  Jocelyn said "Do you know how much it costs to freeze them? I think just to extract them was about $4,000 ….. No, I wasn't going to do that to me and my partner. People don't like to talk about it, but it's expensive having cancer even with a really nice medical care system like we have here, not everything's covered."</p>
<p>Some  women such as Carol, Naoual, and Ginette made use of private clinics for some  of their treatment. While they had to pay out-of-pocket, in general they felt  that they received faster or better services. Carol balanced the use of private  and public services based on how urgent they were: &ldquo;The biopsy I needed  immediately for the diagnosis, the surgery I wanted done right away, but then  afterwards you have a CAT* scan, you have an MRI**, you have several other thing  but I didn&rsquo;t need those results right away so I chose do to those at the  hospital.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Getting back to work</h2>
<p>Isla, who returned to work, spoke about being lucky to have a supportive environment for a gradual return, but felt that this may not be possible for other jobs, such as teachers or nurses.</p>

<div class="clear"></div>

<p>Returning to work was an eye-opener for Joanne as she realized her body was not back to normal yet. Shelley was thankful that her medical team convinced her to take a bit more time before returning back to work. Quite a few women wanted to get back to work as soon as possible. Jeanette pushed to get back to work and enjoyed it: "To be at work the whole time, it was great. You go into work, you do your job for 8 hours, you don't have time to think about yourself and you just do your work." Kathryn, who is not allowed to go back to work, is giving back by volunteering in her community.</p>
<p>Margaret,  Shelley and others also returned to work gradually. Shelley entered a formal  return to work program. One woman, still in treatment felt that she wanted more  time off and that returning to work would be a lot to manage. Several women  commented that balancing an illness with family and work could be overwhelming. </p>
