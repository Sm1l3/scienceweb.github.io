		<p>If you can’t do them as  energetically as you did, do them a little less. That’s why I say go to the  gym, exercise, and if you don’t like going to gyms, walk. Women run, they run  before, during and after treatment. I just don’t think you should just stop  dead. I mean, if you just stop everything you’re doing, that’s not going to  make the cancer go away. It’s there, it’s being treated. Yeah, your energy is  not going to be as good for the first while, but just do as little or as much  as you can. If you’re married and you want to use it as an excuse for somebody  to clean your house, do it. But if you want to keep cleaning your own house,  clean your own house. I do think exercise is important, I mean, the research  studies that have been done here and that they’ve now started to do in other  places, indicate that exercising during cancer treatment has no ill effect on  you whatsoever. You may feel ill while you’re having the treatment, but it’s  not from the exercising and the exercising is not going to hurt you. And you  don’t have to exercise as heavily as you did before at all. Go for a very slow  walk on a treadmill, that’s the most boring thing on the face of this earth,  but if that’s what you can do, then that’s what you need to do.</p>
