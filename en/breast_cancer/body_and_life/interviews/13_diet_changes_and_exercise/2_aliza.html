		<p><strong>Interviewer</strong>:  Did you change your diet after your diagnosis?</p>
        <p>It’s been many years that I am… because  I followed the… because I was obese and I followed the Weight Watchers diet.  That’s about it. This is what I eat.</p>
        <p>But now since it is less appealing, like  for restaurant, things like that, since there are all kinds of things like… I  feel less like it. And now my life has a certain effect; you can say that it’s  a big change.</p>
        <p><strong>Interviewer: </strong>So you don’t feel like eating or eat less?</p>

So I am trying to… But this, it  sounds almost like very  intellectual, I  am trying to have a discipline to be able to have fun but… I think the fun side  is very affected.</p>
        <p>Good meals,… I don’t drink anymore. It  doesn’t appeal to me anymore, not that I drank a lot. May be like a glass of  wine like anybody else. I think it has affected the whole perception of fun.</p></div>
