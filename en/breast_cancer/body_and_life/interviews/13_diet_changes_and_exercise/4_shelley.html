		<p>More to the fruit and  vegetables. Yeah, I still have a hankering every once in a while for red meat  but, we talk about balanced diets. I’ve talked to nutritionists, I’ve read many  books on the benefits of a vegetarian diet or the whole grain diets. There’s so  many different avenues. But I think for me what it comes down to is a balanced  diet, and ensuring that the fruits and vegetables are not ignored and the water  intake is so important for me to help cope with some of these new aches, pains,  muscle cramps and things like that. The family love it. At first they weren’t  too sure about the green drinks, I’ll be honest with you, but once they looked  beyond the colour, it’s been a good thing and all of them juice. All of them  make smoothies, and it’s a fun thing to do because what do we have. It always  used to be, dad’s making the smoothies expect everything and the kitchen sink  to go in it. Everyone has their vices and the green has been a staple so that  has been good. </p>
        <p>Even, with your, or with the  way we look at buying groceries has definitely changed too. The grocery list,  and no my house is not junk food free by any means. I probably still eat way  too much junk food but I find if I say absolutely cut off, &quot;No&quot; I  will crave it. If I have it in the house, it’s like &quot;Okay it’s there if I  want it, I don’t know if I want it.&quot; It’s just, it’s different. I don’t  bake as much as I used to, if I do, it’s a lot of whole foods, different recipe  books that I’ve come across. There’s so many wonderful online resources for  making everything, whether it’s gluten free or just on a vegetarian or a vegan  diet. Whatever is your fancy, but there’s many good things out there and I’m  very lucky.</p>
