		<p>Yes, I did a lot of research on  that too. I actually had tried to stop eating meat and I did for probably about  2 months but it was really hard when I was doing the chemo. Once I started the  chemo, it was really hard because I was always nauseous, and it was hard to get  the right proteins and stuff that would last long and so I wasn’t able to keep  that up. But, on the Internet, there’s a lot of research from pretty respective  areas that say that maybe red meat might not be the best to eat, so I try to  stick to chicken and fish etc. I’m a little healthier, it’s hard with kids, but  not as much sugar, not as much white flour, refined flours and stuff like that.  But everything feels like it takes an extra effort to do.It feels like you’re  in a pool and you’re walking, but the steps are really hard, and to swing your  arms under water is that much harder and that’s what it feels like a lot of  times. That everything is weighted down, so to do anything, takes more effort  than it would normally.</p>
        <p>I feel like I’m on a path. I  don’t know if I’ve changed very much yet. I’m determined to live a healthier  active lifestyle. If you do some reading, they say, keeping your optimal  weight, keeping active are two big, big things in lowering the risk of having  the cancer come back. I’m not living that as much as I would like right now,  but, I would like to think that’s the chemo that’s preventing me, but we’ll  see. Hopefully I will change my life in that way for the better.</p>
