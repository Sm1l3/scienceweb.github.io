		<p>No I didn’t do any  complimentary treatment, but if there was one thing that I knew I had control  over it was what I ate and so like I said, I completely cut alcohol. They said  that we were allowed to, according to the chemotherapy guidelines of what you  can and cannot do. It said that I could have some, if I wanted to have one  drink. I could have wine and all that but I didn’t see the point to it. I wanted  to really try to keep my body as clean as possible knowing that it was about to  be intoxicated with chemotherapy. So I tried to do my best to change my diet, I  tried to cut off sugar almost completely. I ate a lot of greens, that was  suggested, and I did juicing a lot, just to get extra nutrients and vitamins  over my meals and stuff. I just wanted to try to have a really healthy diet  during treatment and as always, but even more.</p>
        <p><strong>Interviewer: </strong>But you managed to make those changes during your  treatment because some women find that pretty hard to do?<strong></strong></p>
        <p>Exactly but like I said, I live  at home and my parents and my family were extremely supportive. I started off  juicing myself but the times that I was extremely weak, I woke up every morning  and I had a juice ready for me, from my dad or my aunt, who actually lives with  me. Like I told you, we’re a very big family, so, a lot of people would think  that that’s a hard thing to be so many in one house, but like, in my case it,  was pretty lifesaving.</p></div>
