		<p>I&rsquo;ve  been very open at work with all of the treatments, with the reconstruction that  I&rsquo;ve undergone here recently. We have many, many jokes and laughs about  different things but people care, they truly do care and when I&rsquo;m not feeling  right for whatever reason, whether it&rsquo;s tiredness, a new surgery is coming up  or medical appointments that impacts me. And even though it&rsquo;s a 6 month check,  that week before I&rsquo;m on edge and I don&rsquo;t anticipate anything wrong but you  never know. I didn&rsquo;t anticipate cancer in the first place and I let my staff  know as I do with family and friend of my up-coming appointments: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry if  I&rsquo;m on edge I&rsquo;m going to say sorry now in case I snap at you I don&rsquo;t mean to,&rdquo;  they&rsquo;re very good. I&rsquo;m thankful, I&rsquo;m so thankful to have relationships with not  only my co-workers but my family to say &ldquo;Yeah we know you&rsquo;re maybe stressing a  little bit more because of an upcoming appointment or test or whatever.&rdquo; And  they&rsquo;ve been good, they&rsquo;ve been good. Would I have asked for that in my  previous life? I don&rsquo;t know if I would have said to people &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not feeling  good today leave me alone.&rdquo; Or &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; I would have… I don&rsquo;t know if I  would have.  I&rsquo;ve had to learn to open up  that side of my life through this to improve work relationships, to improve  communication and to let them know where I&rsquo;m at on a daily basis.</p></div>
