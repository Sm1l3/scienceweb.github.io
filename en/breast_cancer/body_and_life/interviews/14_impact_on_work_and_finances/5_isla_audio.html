		<p>My (working place) is  a very nice place to get sick because people are very understanding and very  smart about what they say so it&rsquo;s lovely. So the impact on work wasâ€¦ I couldn&rsquo;t  keep the teaching up during that time and they were very understanding. I had a  6 month leave available and I took it and I came back after that. I had taken  on a larger administrative job 2 weeks before my diagnosis and just because I&rsquo;m  still in treatment and there&rsquo;s some side-effects, I&rsquo;m not headed back to that  position in January as previously planned, so it has impacted my career for  sure. A lot of people with a chronic illness will say that their career got  somewhat derailed by that. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a long-term derailment but it&rsquo;s  certainly a short-term one.</p>
        <p>That&rsquo;s right, but  right now, with still in active treatment, it&rsquo;s inadvisable mostly because, I&rsquo;m  sure people listening to this will understand, cancer is a busy job. You have a  lot of appointments. It&rsquo;s very hard for you to be relied upon in a workplace  setting if there&rsquo;s less flexibility. I need the flexibility now to say &ldquo;Well no  I can&rsquo;t meet tomorrow because I&rsquo;m in treatment.&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&rsquo;m having a follow-up  exam.&rdquo; and I don&rsquo;t want everyone to continuously have to work around me. I kind  of pre-empted that by keeping the job with a lot more flexibility so that it&rsquo;s  okay to be at work at the hospital with my set-up and I can still get things  done but I don&rsquo;t need to be in a face-to-face meeting.</p>
        <p>It&rsquo;s a huge issue for  women. I think some of the research that shows women don&rsquo;t come back to the  same level of job or they lose their job or feel that they can&rsquo;t continue with  it. I can totally see why. I was really lucky I have a flexible employer and I  had access to paid leave and that is a tremendous benefit. I&rsquo;m lucky to have a  job that has all of those things, but I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s true for all women.  I&rsquo;m lucky that I have a decent job and my spouse has a decent job and he didn&rsquo;t  lose a lot of time during that. But absolutely, for women, the job loss or  keeping their jobs during it I think is very, very difficult and I&rsquo;m sure it  derails careers and it derails earning potential for sure, like other  illnesses.</p>
