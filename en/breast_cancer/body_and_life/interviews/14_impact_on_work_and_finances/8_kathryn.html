		<p>My  oncologist told me in 2003, &ldquo;No&rdquo; I wanted to go back to work, &ldquo;No you can&rsquo;t go  back to work, too many germs, your immune system&rsquo;s compromised.&rdquo; And he didn&rsquo;t  think I was going to be alive very long so he said &ldquo;No, no work.&rdquo; So I said &ldquo;Okay&rdquo;  I listened because â€¦I really realized teaching is a very stressful job, I  didn&rsquo;t realize it until I didn&rsquo;t do it anymore, how stressful it was. You&rsquo;ve  got 30 kids trying to make mincemeat, I had high school, mincemeat out of you  everyday. I had one time a kid told me are you going to cry miss? I said I&rsquo;m  not going to cry, I was strict but kind, but I said &ldquo;No, no, no you&rsquo;re going to  be crying a lot further, sooner than me.&rdquo; But anyway it&rsquo;s a very stressful job  and he was probably smart to tell me that I couldn&rsquo;t go back to teach. Maybe if  I could do it part-time, but you can&rsquo;t really do the job that I had part-time  because you have a class and the kids in high school they can&rsquo;t really adjust  the schedule very much so, I just didn&rsquo;t work. And it was probably a blessing.</p>
