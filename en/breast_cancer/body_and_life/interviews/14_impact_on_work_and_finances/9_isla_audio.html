		<p>I  love my job but I <a name="_GoBack" id="_GoBack"></a>needed to be away from it. I&rsquo;ll be very  honest about that, but I was also happy when it was coming time to come back. </p>
        <p>You&rsquo;re  too occupied with your kids and your illness and the appointments. Just taking  away the stress of having to juggle everything was really valuable for me  during that time period. I&rsquo;m grateful for paid leave, which we pay into as  employees. And which your employer pays into too and which we take when we get  sick but that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s for, it&rsquo;s an insurance.</p>
        <p>This was all very  manageable, so for anyone else facing it, it is manageable. I kept teaching  until Christmas and at that point, I stopped teaching because it was a little  bit harder, plus, I had kids. So as I said to my employer,&rdquo; I could do kids and  cancer or work and cancer but I couldn&rsquo;t do kids, work and cancer.&rdquo; I took a  leave of absence during the heavy lifting part of chemo but I was able to  maintain a fairly normal life. I was cross-country skiing. I don&rsquo;t say this  like a badge of honour because not everyone&rsquo;s going to feel like doing that. But,  for me, carrying on a normal life, trying to get away for weekends, keeping up  with cross-country in particular which my husband and I really enjoy, remaining  active trying to eat well, was very important to me and was all doable during  that time.        </p></div>
