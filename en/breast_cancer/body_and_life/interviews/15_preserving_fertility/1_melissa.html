		<p>My husband is fairly certain that he doesn’t want  to have any more children but I hadn’t really closed that off. With chemotherapy  you can often go into menopause, especially if you’re closer to 40 or already closer  to menopause. I thought that that was what was going to happen and that was  pretty traumatic for me. Just having that decision taken away from me by  another decision that I made, made me feel a little bit uneasy and very disappointed.  It's not because necessarily we would have more children but because decision  is no longer mine. That was a bit challenging. Since that point, I’ve been  tested and apparently I’m not at that stage yet so that’s been a bit of a  relief.</p></div>
