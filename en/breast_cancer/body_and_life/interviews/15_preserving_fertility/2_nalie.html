		<p>I had to  purposely take Lupron shots to protect my fertility because I found out that when  doing chemotherapy you can become infertile. To me having children of my own in  the future is a huge, huge importance in my life. I also ended up freezing my  eggs prior to doing chemotherapy and not only did I freeze my eggs I agreed to  take Lupron injections which put you under menopause. So their theory in the  reproductive centre is that they say that if you’re not producing any eggs then  there’s less of a chance of the chemotherapy harming them.</p>
        <p>So I was  under menopause at the age of 24 or 25. I was going through menopause with the  hot flashes, and all of that on top of chemotherapy symptoms and side-effects.  But I wanted to do it,  I thought it was  important for me to know that I did whatever it took to protect my fertility.  So being in menopause your body changes as well, so that’s one thing I had to  go through physically, that was challenging.</p></div>
