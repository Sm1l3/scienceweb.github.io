<p>Yes, the  fertility subject was a little difficult for me. I didn&rsquo;t have much time to  decide if I wanted to freeze egg cells. I think I had two days. I just had… it  was a short time after my surgery; I was recovering from my operation. I had an  infection and I think I didn&rsquo;t even tell my spouse at the time. I didn&rsquo;t really  have time. And he had already told me that we had one child and he was fine  with it. But for me, in my mind I always wanted to have 2 or 3 kids. I would  have liked my daughter to have brothers and sisters. And finally, very quickly  I decided that I wouldn&rsquo;t freeze my eggs because I didn&rsquo;t want to go through  another kind of process and then… The… When I was reading about the success  rate of in vitro fertilization and all that after, it was not reassuring. So I  told myself: &ldquo;Why would I go through this now? I am going through a lot and if  I become infertile because of the chemo, well that will be it.&rdquo;</p></div>
