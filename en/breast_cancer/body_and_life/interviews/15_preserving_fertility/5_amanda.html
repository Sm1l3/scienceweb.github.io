<p>I had the  surgery and then 4 weeks later I was in Ottawa for an egg retrieval. That was...  so much had to come together during that 4-week period because we were waiting  for so long for... I had the surgery in March and then the pathology didn’t  come back until weeks later. Then finally when the pathology was back it,  showed it was in one lymph node which meant definitely, yes I would be needing  chemotherapy and radiation and the whole shebang. As soon as I found out that  chemo was a thing, I knew I’d have to do the egg retrieval, and all that had to  happen in one day. It was one Friday where I saw the medical oncologist and  then, because of where my cycle was and stuff, I had to start the fertility  drugs and prepare for the egg retrieval, to not delay the start of  chemotherapy. That was another really hard day. It was really hard on the day  when I found out I need chemo and I need to start the fertility drugs today  before 4 o’clock and that was at 3 o’clock, so it was  hard. </p>
<p>I knew  straightaway that for me having to do chemo, I was going to do egg freezing. The  first day I got the information, I kind of thought it through and thought maybe  I shouldn’t do this but then I thought &quot;No&quot; I should, because the  main barrier about why I wouldn’t have done it would have been financial and I  wasn’t going to let that stop me. Because I don’t know, I think that $10,000  for the procedure and then all the other expenses aside it’s minor over the  span of a lifetime for something that’s so important. So I didn’t want that to  be the reason why I didn’t do it. So it was kind of like if I need chemo, I’m going  to get egg freezing and that’s how it’s going to be and that was it for me, I  just knew. It was a lot to think about though, because it’s just, there’s all  sorts of stuff about the probability of eggs translating to a pregnancy or not.  It’s not overly high, especially with eggs instead of embryos. You’re kind of  thinking &quot;God why am I even doing all this is there’s not even a high  percentage it’s going to work out.&quot; But there is a slight chance, it could  always work. Lots of people go through it and it works for them, so I thought  why not just make sure the option is there. If I come through this chemo and I  can’t have... if my fertility is totally compromised and I can’t do this on my  own, then at least I have that option there. Because fertility, losing your  fertility is a potential side-effect of chemo. It doesn’t happen to everyone,  especially if you’re younger, they say there’s a better chance of your ovaries  recovering and coming through the chemo. Okay! But it’s still not a sure thing.  I thought if there was something I could do I would do it.</p>
