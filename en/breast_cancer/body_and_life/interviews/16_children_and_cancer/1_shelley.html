		<p>The kids all got home from school that  afternoon. We sat them down. They were teenagers, first year university and two  in high school and I let them know that I was diagnosed with cancer that a  biopsy was going to happen and that’s all I knew. Lots of tears, lots of  questions. The one thing I wanted them to know was that it was absolutely okay  to text their friends, to let their friends know, to talk about it with their  friends’ parents because at that age friends are their life. And then, they  worry about themselves. Parents are somewhere down lower on that priority list.  I didn’t want them to be scared in silence or alone and I wanted them to be  able to ask me and my husband questions. That was something my husband and I  had spoke about before we told the kids. Now that it’s been almost 3 years  since that initial diagnosis, we’ve talked about how we told them and whether or  not we should have said talk to your friends. They thought that was absolutely  awesome that they didn’t feel they had to sneak and it was a secret that the  family had. Their friends were open to ask us questions as well. It just so  happened with my daughter going into nursing, and for her friends in nursing I  became their test patient in many regards. It was a good learning experience  but we always said &quot;If you don’t know don’t be scared of what you don’t  know, ask and if we don’t know the answer we would find the answer.&quot;</p></div>
