		<p>It was Thanksgiving weekend,  and I called my husband and told him you better, you had best come home and I  was very upset, he was very upset and he didn&rsquo;t want me to tell my children. He  wanted... and I was like... so that was more upsetting because it was about a  week after that I finally told them. They were only in Grade 7 and 9 then. He  was like &quot;I don&rsquo;t think you should tell them.&quot; And I said &quot;You  got to tell them, I cannot, I can&rsquo;t just go and have a mastectomy and not tell  them.&quot; I had the lumpectomy done and I didn&rsquo;t tell them because... and  even my mom who&rsquo;s now 80, he didn&rsquo;t want her to know. I was like &quot;I&rsquo;ve got  to tell her I can't, how can you not tell your family.&quot; So that was really  tormenting for the first week, how was I going to tell my children. I remember  having, I was supposed to go back to work that particular Friday night, and I  said to the surgeon &quot;I just can&rsquo;t go back to work right now.&quot; So  about a week later I told them, I said to them &quot;Have you wondered why I&rsquo;ve  not gone back to work yet?&quot; And they were kind of &quot;Yeah&quot; and I  said &quot;Well I&rsquo;ve got to have more surgery.&quot; And then I said &quot;I  have had breast cancer and I would rather for you to hear it from me.&quot;  Because at that point I was afraid... my husband&rsquo;s family they have a big  construction company and this is a small community. People find out things and  then people talk. I&rsquo;d rather for them to hear it from me than to hear it from  one of their friends&rsquo; parents or something. So I told them. And I said &quot;I&rsquo;d  rather for you to hear it from me.&quot; And I said &quot;What I&rsquo;m telling you  is the truth and if you have any questions you come to me, I&rsquo;d rather for you  to hear it than to think that I&rsquo;m hiding something. You&rsquo;re hearing it from  someone else and you don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on, right?&rdquo;</p>
