		<p>The day before I went in for surgery, I sat  down and said that I had some bad cells. I used bad cells instead of cancer for  a couple of different reasons. I think it&rsquo;s really important for kids to... at various  different ages to hear the different kinds of information. Bad cells they can  relate to something&rsquo;s wrong and that it&rsquo;s got to be taken out, especially at  age five. That was easy for him. Using the cancer word or the &lsquo;C&rsquo; word I think  is just terrifying because they see different things and they hear different  things about people dying of cancer. Until you know where your stage is at and  what kind of diagnosis you&rsquo;re actually going to have, I think that&rsquo;s almost  like overwhelming and it creates a little bit more fear in their little minds  than it&rsquo;s worth type of thing. </p>
