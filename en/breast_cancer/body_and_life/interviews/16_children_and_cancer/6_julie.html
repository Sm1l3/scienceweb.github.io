		<p>My daughter  was 2 ½ years old when I had my first surgery and I was very honest with her. I  used the words that you must use with a two and a half years old, and in her  two and a half years old mind she understood what she wanted to understand.  Also, I involved her a lot in my care.  I  had… I didn&rsquo;t hide my dressings, I didn&rsquo;t hide my medications. I was explaining  to her; she was asking questions and I was explaining to her the best way that  I could. I didn&rsquo;t want my daughter to be afraid of the sickness. So to me, it  is important to demystify for the kids that we still can live with cancer. When  I was young, cancer for me meant death, but now for me it doesn&rsquo;t mean that. It  is a sickness that I have; I don&rsquo;t know when I will die. But nobody knows when  they will die. Yes, I have medications, I have treatments, I am tired, I have  side effects and all that. I have symptoms… And my daughter understands that  her mommy lives with that, it is part of our daily life. Mommy is tired and  must rest, she respects that. I brought my daughter to radiotherapy treatments  to see what it was like. Because I had some in 2010 and also in 2012, and in  2013, so she progressed in all that.  She  also learned that her mother could also live with that. It doesn&rsquo;t prevent me  from doing things with her, she understands that. She also understands that her  mommy cannot work and that… it may be… it is because of the sickness, so… But I  am saying to myself that I am there at least when she comes back from school. I  am at home and I am present. I am lucky to have a child that is very  autonomous, she is very curious, very lively. I know that it is not the same  for everybody. I believe that my daughter also helped me a lot in all that. If  I didn&rsquo;t have a kid to take care of, maybe I would have had a bigger  depression. To have to get up in the morning for a child, make breakfast; the  child is depending on you. So somewhere the choice is: &ldquo;I am going through the  day with my child or I have to call someone.&rdquo; And that someone is not available  or… So I decided that first I was going to take care of my daughter. I take  care of myself too. She understands that it is important that her mother takes  care of herself. So we set out our priorities.</p></div>
