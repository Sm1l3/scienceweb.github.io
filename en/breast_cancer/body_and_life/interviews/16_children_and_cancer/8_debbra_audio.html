		<p>Children  have got to be the hardest thing to put into this equation. I think if he  wasn’t around it would be so much easier because you’re brain goes to what’s going  to happen? Am I going to see him go to Grade 12, and am I going to be able to  be there for him? And it’s really, really difficult. How much information do  you tell him? And one thing that I really realize is that you now go from a  5-year-old to an 11-year-old and their brain changes and their ability to  comprehend completely change and they sense. My son and I are incredibly close  and they sense it, if you don’t say something they go to a really dark place  and they think the worst and stuff like that. They don’t need to know  everything. He didn’t know a lot of the places where it was he just knew that the  cancer had come back. He maybe... we were lucky because when he was younger mom  beat cancer, right... so mom’s going to be okay. So he doesn’t quite get the  fact that I probably won’t be okay. And that’s okay. He doesn’t need to know  that. I sat him down after I got all the information and that’s again, I didn’t  want to tell him before I had all the information because I wanted to be able  to give him a true picture of what was going to happen. And you keep it in  honest minimal detail. I guess would be the best... I can say it and he just  understood that the cancer had come back. Now this is going to mean that we  have to go back through chemo and radiation and all that sort of stuff.<br />
 <br />
On the  metastatic journey or the advanced breast cancer journey, how I discussed it  with my son was to say that it had come back and that we have to go after it. If  you’re listening to this as you’ve already probably been told is that  metastatic isn’t going to go away. You’re going to have cancer in you at some  degree and you’re never going to be cancer free or be classified as cancer  free. So I was honest with my son and just sort of said, I used the term that  it was like a chronic condition that we’re always going to have to be watching  it and that I’ll always be going through different treatments and have  treatments and it’ll vary how I respond to the treatments in terms of...if the  cancer comes back or when the cancer comes. Not if the cancer comes back but if  the cancer starts to grow again and different things like that. That seemed to  provide him with some ability to get his head around it and not to put him in a  scary spot. Some kids they’re the social workers at most places will have  programs for children. My son never wanted to go to one but I always tried to  find some time where it was just him and I. I found snuggling with him in his  bed where we’re not looking eye contact, then he could ask some questions and  some hard questions like am I, &quot;Are you going to die?&quot; And things  like that and you’re going to get that question depending on the age or if you  don’t get the question you should bring up the question because it’s going to  be in their heads. That’s a very difficult question and you should probably  think through it because it’s a hard one to deal with. </p>
        <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Can you tell me how you responded to that question?</p>
        <p>I felt it  was very important and what I had read is that you have to be as honest as  possible because then if you’re not then they feel that you’ve lied to them and  there’s a lot of anger afterwards if you do die. That’s what I had read so what  I chose to do with him is I introduced it slowly, let him get used to the idea  and then I would snuggle and then just ask him about different things or say  different things and try to bring him out. And then when he did ask that  question I told him that I didn’t know. I said, I was honest and I said &quot;This  one I don’t know if we can, if mommy will ever be, I will never be cancer free  and I don’t know what this is going to mean. But all I can tell you is that I’m  going to fight my hardest to do everything I possibly can to beat this.&quot; Because  that’s something that he could understand and relate to. But if you want to be  brutally honest is to live as long as you can but I think at 11 he doesn’t need  to hear that. I think to make sure that I’m around to beat this is okay. In his  idea of beating it is just make sure the cancer doesn’t come back. And then,  they can only, I was just giving him little bits of information at a time in  terms of what it meant and things like that.</p>
