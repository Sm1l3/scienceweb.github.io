		<p>I  think that more needs to be done in terms of working with the couple for the  intimacy factor and stuff like that. I know I never had any discussions about  it with my GP (General Practitioner) or anything like that. I think it’s  something... where do you go and talk about this stuff? There’s really not a  lot that’s said. You’re on drugs that dry all your estrogen which means that  you know you have a whole bunch of other things that are happening. Your  arousal, all that other stuff doesn’t happen and you still want to be... you  might want to be but you also don’t feel attractive. You’ve lost your hair, I  didn’t really feel very attractive being bald and there’s no hair anywhere. That  part, I think is hard for them, because not only are they losing parts of their  wife they’re losing the intimacy factor. And maybe other couples are different  and they manage around it differently but I know that was a struggle.</p>
