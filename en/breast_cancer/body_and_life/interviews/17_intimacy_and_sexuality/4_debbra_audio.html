		<p>I, never  read anything, so maybe there’s a way, maybe there’s a sex therapist that can  give some views on how to change the intimacy process when you’re missing  parts. Because, that’s what... you feel you’re missing parts. Especially as a  double, you don’t have any stimulation on the breasts anymore and you don’t  feel a lot depending on how your scars heal and how much scar tissue you have  and stuff like that. So it’s even with big ones, they don’t feel the same. That  kind of stuff. So something, and I don’t even know whereabouts to go to get  that information, because I never thought to look it up. But I think it should  be something that is discussed and something that’s brought up sooner rather  than later. Because if you can ease into it, then it doesn’t become such an  issue later on.</p>
