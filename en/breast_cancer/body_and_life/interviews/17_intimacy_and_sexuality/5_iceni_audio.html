        <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Because of the treatment?</p>
        <p>Yeah because  of yeah, which is horrible because nobody tells you that. It doesn’t stop you  from being loving and doing other things but not actual intercourse. I remember  when I had my pap test a year after, and she said &quot;Oh intercourse is out.&quot;  I said &quot;What!&quot; She says &quot;No you can’t.&quot; I say &quot;Why?&quot;  She says &quot;Because you’re a mess in there.&quot; I say &quot;Well what do  you mean?&quot; She says &quot;Well you must have had radiation for cancer down  there.&quot; I said &quot;No.&quot; So I never got to the bottom of that, how  that happened and it’s too painful.</p>
