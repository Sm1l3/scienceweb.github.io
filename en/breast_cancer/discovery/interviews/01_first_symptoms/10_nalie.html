		<p>I felt the bumps on my left breast at the age of 23,  if I remember, so it was almost 10 months before actually doing something about  it. I was in the shower and I had just worked out because I used to be really,  really active and sporty and fit. So I came back from the gym once and I was  just scrubbing my upper body and as I was scrubbing my left breast. I felt  lumps, but my initial reaction was,&nbsp;&ldquo;It must just be my muscles or  something,&rdquo; because I had just worked out my chest and so I didn&rsquo;t do anything about  it. I didn&rsquo;t think it was  anything at all. It didn&rsquo;t even scare me. It  didn&rsquo;t faze me. And it  just so happened that a few months after I had a family doctor appointment. So  I went to go see my family doctor and she usually does a breast exam and I told  her that my left breast felt a little bumpy. She told me that it was normal in  our 20s.We tend to have more bumpy breasts because of fibers and hormones and  fat. So she felt it and she&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, it&rsquo;s probably just a cyst.&rdquo; So I didn&rsquo;t even worry at all  but she gave me a referral paper just in case.&nbsp;And so when she gave me the  referral paper I didn&rsquo;t really do anything with it because she told me not to worry.  And when you&rsquo;re like in your 20s it&rsquo;s not a priority to go book you know like  at that point I thought a mammogram. And I let months pass and finally I took  the referral paper after a second shot where my doctor had to give it to me  again because I had lost it. That&rsquo;s how much I really didn&rsquo;t even care about  it.</p>
