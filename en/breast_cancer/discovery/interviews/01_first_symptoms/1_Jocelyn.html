		<p>I was reading in bed in my bedroom without a shirt on  and I was reading my book. I went to scratch my boob and I felt a craggy, like  a pretty hard lump, inside it. It was big. I scratched it and I was like &ldquo;What  is that?&rdquo; So I woke up my partner and I was like &ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; and he was  like &ldquo;Well I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo; and I went to  the doctor the next day. They got me in right away and I was 29. So he was like  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s kind of strange&rdquo;. He  said, &ldquo;Oh it&rsquo;s probably nothing  because of your age because it&rsquo;s so unlikely. But if you&rsquo;re going to worry  about it we&rsquo;ll put you in for a  mammogram and then  we&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
