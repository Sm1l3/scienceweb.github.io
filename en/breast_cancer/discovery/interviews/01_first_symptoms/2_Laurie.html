		<p>About just over a year ago  when I went for my annual exam with my GP (General Practitioner) and she did  the breast exam. First, she felt right here on this breast and then she went &ldquo;Hmm&rdquo;,  and then she felt on this side and she went &ldquo;Hmm&rdquo;, and then she came back to  this side. And whenever they go back and feel again that&rsquo;s a bad sign. She said &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I think I feel  something here.&rdquo; Like it was right here.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know for sure, like you can&rsquo;t really feel a lump, but  it just feels not quite right. So I think you should go and have an  ultrasound.&rdquo;</p></div>
