		<p>Mine was a unique start in  my journey. I lost an aunt and it wasn’t to breast cancer but it was to cancer.  And for some reason I just had this feeling in my gut that there was just  something and I can’t  explain it. And so, I just went to my physician and asked to have a mammogram  early. And then all the things lined up. So with the mammogram, they’d seen something suspicious  and then they sent me for an ultrasound. And I was just lucky that I had a  senior ultrasound technician who realized that what she was seeing was just  different than what she’s  normally used to seeing. She wasn’t  seeing a lump because I was diagnosed with mucinous cancer, which is a slimy  cancer that sort of spreads and so you don’t  get the lump. I did have another component to my cancer but it was a smaller  component. So it was very, very fortunate that I had an experienced ultrasound  person who saw it. </p>
