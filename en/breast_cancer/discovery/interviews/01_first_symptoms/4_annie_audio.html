		<p>So, I was  starting to see some changes during the month of July 2013. Among other things,  the size of my left breast was increasing. As the month evolved, the breast was  getting bigger and bigger.  At some  point, the breast became painful – it was very painful, warm and red. And at  some point, the skin had changed (the appearance). The skin was not as it used  to be. But, one morning I was woken up, and there was a lymph node – what I  thought was a lymph node, that I was feeling. Then I was questioning myself  because I had no idea of what I had, because I always heard that a breast cancer  was not painful. Thus, I did not suspect that it could be that.</p>
        <p>But at the  same time, at 36 I was not part of the high risk target group for breast  cancer. I was wondering what I had. I did not think it was serious. But on July  26, 2013 I went to a walk-in clinic because at that time it was really painful  and I was wondering. The doctor, that I saw, told me that it could be a  mastitis, a breast infection, but that he suspected that it was a rare form of  breast cancer called inflammatory breast cancer. And he told me that he was  worried. It was a Friday afternoon and he told me: &ldquo;It is a private clinic or  the emergency.&rdquo; It is not often that a doctor tells you that he is worried. So  I panicked a little bit. </p>
