		<p>I was putting my daughter to bed and was laying on my side when I  realized that there was something strange with my breast. I felt a lump, which  was sensitive. Then I asked my partner at the time to have a look at it. I  showed it to him. We thought it was a little strange and it stayed on my mind.  It was around the month of November. At the beginning of December I went to the  doctor with my daughter who had a bad cough. At the same time, I discussed my  case with the doctor and said: &ldquo;I have a lump. Should we check it?&rdquo; I was 30  years old at the time. And he told me: &ldquo;Usually when it is a cancer you don&rsquo;t  feel anything, but we will do an ultrasound anyway. But don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo;</p></div>
