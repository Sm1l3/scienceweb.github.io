		<p>Okay, so back in 2011 I was  sort of dabbling with Reiki. Reiki is a transfer of energy. It&rsquo;s an alternative  style of therapy and I was working on myself, family and  friends; and I was working my daughter&rsquo;s friend&rsquo;s mum&rsquo;s back. She was having  some pain and every time I was working on her back or her side she would get a  burning sensation, and I would too (experience this burning sensation) on my  breast. We kind of joked about that and I said, &ldquo;You know what? Go get checked  out,&rdquo; and she did and she was diagnosed with breast cancer. </p>
		<p>So my physical was coming up that summer of August  (2011) and I had been working with her and giving her Reiki treatments  throughout her chemotherapy and I had mentioned (this burning sensation) to my  doctor. I said, &ldquo;You know I do Reiki and every time I&rsquo;m working on this patient  or any time I&rsquo;m working on myself and I pass my hands over my right breast I  feel this sensation, like I could breastfeed somebody, kind of that tingling  before the milk is let down sensation.&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;Oh you&rsquo;re young, you&rsquo;re 45,  don&rsquo;t worry about it.&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;It could be anything but let&rsquo;s have a  mammogram.&rdquo; Like we couldn&rsquo;t feel anything, I couldn&rsquo;t, she couldn&rsquo;t and so she  said, &ldquo;Well we&rsquo;ll get a baseline mammogram.&rdquo; So I went and I got a call back  from it and I thought, &ldquo;Oh boy what is this?&rdquo; I went to the doctor for the  results and she had told me not to worry. There&rsquo;s a little bit of something but  not to worry, come back in 3-6 months. But my vitamin B was low and my vitamin  D was low so we started on that kind of (vitamin) therapy. I&rsquo;m not overweight  and I&rsquo;m fairly active, and I eat fairly well. But she was pretty confident, as  was I, that there was nothing. </p>
		<p>But we decided on a 3-month retest with the mammogram  because I thought I can&rsquo;t go six months without sleep, let&rsquo;s go 3 months. And  so I went in November and the very next day I had a call back. I got the phone  call to come into the office, which again, I thought, &ldquo;No big deal, they must  have found something else or just the results.&rdquo; I was not expecting &ldquo;you have  cancer&rdquo;. She told me that and when I heard the words &ldquo;you have cancer&rdquo; I can  truly say I don&rsquo;t remember much else. </p>
