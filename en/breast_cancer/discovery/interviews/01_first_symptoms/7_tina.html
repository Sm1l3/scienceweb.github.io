		<p>Well when I first suspected  something was wrong was after a 2-month period where I had thought it was  fibrous cysts in the breast because I used to have those quite a bit. And one  time, I went to a surgeon and he suggested coming off coffee because the coffee  was causing the fibrous cysts. And once I came off coffee they were gone. But  this time, after 2 months, they didn’t go away. So I knew something else was  going on and it was so prominent because it was right beside the nipple and it  was a hard, big hard lump. So then I decided I better go to the doctor and see  what’s  going on.</p></div>
