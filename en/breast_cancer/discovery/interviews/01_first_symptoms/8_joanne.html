		<p>I guess I first noticed a small lump on my breast  myself. I was fairly young at the time. It was a couple of years before my  diagnosis that I&nbsp;noticed a lump. And the first doctor I showed it to wasn&rsquo;t concerned at all. He  said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re young,&rdquo; and at the  time I had had an ectopic pregnancy. So he had said maybe with hormonal changes  with the pregnancy&nbsp;and my body going back to normal, it was changing, my breast  tissue was changing, and he said to check it again in a couple of months. And  in a couple of months it seemed to have changed or maybe I wanted it to have  gone away, but it was still there. So then I had a friend who had a lump on her  breast and I left her one night, her and her husband, and they were quite  concerned about the lump on her breast. So when I went home, I talked to my  husband about her reaction. I said, &ldquo;You know, my friend is reacting with a lot  of worry about this little lump and she&rsquo;s young too and she seems to think there might  be something to it.&rdquo; So he said, &ldquo;Yes Joanne, I think you should be worried as  well.&rdquo; So it was actually my husband who pushed me go get it checked  again.</p>
