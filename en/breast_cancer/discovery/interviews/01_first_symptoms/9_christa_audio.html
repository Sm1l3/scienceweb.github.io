		<p>I think I&rsquo;d had one (mammogram) done  before and that was when I was about 34 years old. My mum had it (breast  cancer) when she was 45, and my grandma and all of my aunts had had it as well.  So I kind of thought that I would probably get it, but I didn&rsquo;t think it would be for a  long period of time. But I thought I would just set a baseline up just so we  know what my breast tissue was like and we knew what to look for. Then my  husband and I had started talking about maybe having kids. So I thought I should  probably get a test done because I knew that I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to do that for a  few years after I was pregnant and when I was breastfeeding. So I thought I  would just go and get another test, like a yearly test done just to see if  everything was okay. I was 35 at that time. When I called in to try and get it  done, there was quite a bit of resistance to do it, because they thought I was  too young.&nbsp;So I had to be a little bit more forceful about it. But I was  able to go in and they asked if there was a chance that I could be pregnant. And  at that point in time I think I had been off the pill for a couple of weeks or  a month or something like that. It was probably about a month. I was supposed  to get my menstrual cycle in a couple of weeks and so I said, &ldquo;Well there&rsquo;s a slight possibility,&rdquo;  but I&rsquo;d been  on the pill for 20 years or something like that and I hadn&rsquo;t been off of the pill  for&nbsp;long. So we were just kind of joking around and they said, &ldquo;You know  this time we&rsquo;ll  just do an ultrasound of the tissue and then we won&rsquo;t actually do the mammogram.&rdquo;  So they decided to do that just in case there was a chance I was pregnant. I  had had no tests done or anything and they found a lump at some point in time. I  was the last appointment at the end of the day and so they said, &ldquo;You know,  normally we would just take a biopsy of this right now but, because it&rsquo;s the last appointment in  the day, we&rsquo;ll do  this tomorrow.&rdquo; So I think I came in the next day or the day after and they  took a biopsy of it and I didn&rsquo;t  really think too much of it because I just didn&rsquo;t think it would be that soon.</p>
