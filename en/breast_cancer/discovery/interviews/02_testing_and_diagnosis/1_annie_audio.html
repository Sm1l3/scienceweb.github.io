		<p>It is not often that a doctor tells you that he is worried. So I  panicked a little bit. I thought that I had insurance so I went to a private  clinic and I got an appointment right away, three days after. On Monday  morning, I spent the whole day doing tests. First it was supposed to be only a  breast ultrasound, but finally while doing the examination, the surgeon decided  that a mammogram and a biopsy would be done. So I was thinking that things were  not looking good. Specially that during the weekend I had looked on the  Internet to see what they were saying about the inflammatory cancer. In French  there was nothing much, but in English there was a little bit, but it was  stating that it was fast, aggressive and deadly. So I was a little discouraged  especially since the doctor at the private clinic thought that it was  metastatic and consequently that I was too late.</p></div>
