		<p>The hardest part I think during that time was the waiting and knowing  you had this cancer growing inside of you and you just want it out. You just  want it out, but that sensation, it was always kind of lingering in the  background, that burn that itch and, of course it&rsquo;s on your mind. You don&rsquo;t  know what you know, what stage, how serious, is it located just in the breast,  your mind goes everywhere. <br />
	    The 3-month period was tough.  It&rsquo;s always the idea that you might have something wrong was always lingering  and I tried to find the reassurance that, &ldquo;Okay I&rsquo;m young, I&rsquo;m healthy, I&rsquo;m  active, I don&rsquo;t smoke, I never smoked, I should be okay, right? Cancer&rsquo;s for  old people.&rdquo; It is not for old people, it does not discriminate against age,  size, race, religion it will hit you hard and when it wants. And so the waiting  period, I kept on moving and kept on doing what I do. It was the waiting period.  Once it was confirmed until action started to take place that I found the  toughest, as did my family.</p>
		<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong>  And that was also the period you didn’t know  exactly which kind of cancer you had?</p>
        <p>Correct what stage, what grade,  is it spread, is it the primary source? All of these unknowns and yet it took  time to get those answers but it was difficult and it was difficult on the  kids, they didn’t want to leave my side. My husband took a leave from work as  well, and that was all hard to get used to because you want to see them,  continue on normally and you can see the pain in their faces and the stress  level around. And you try to make it normal and we grew as a family, we really  have a new level of respect for each other. The relationship with the kids and  my husband and I grew during that time, that’s a benefit of something really  awful that I’m fortunate enough to say that we continue to be a very close  family as a result of it. </p>
