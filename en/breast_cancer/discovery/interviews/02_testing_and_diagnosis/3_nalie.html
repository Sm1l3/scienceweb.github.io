	  <p>And so she felt it and she&rsquo;s  like, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry it&rsquo;s probably just a cyst,&rdquo; so I didn&rsquo;t even worry at all  either but she gave me a referral paper just in case.</p>
		<p>And so when she gave me the  referral paper I didn&rsquo;t really do anything with it because she told me not to  worry and when you&rsquo;re in your 20s it&rsquo;s not a priority to go book, at that point  I thought a mammogram. I let months pass and finally I took the referral paper  after a second shot where my doctor had to give it to me again because I had  lost it. That&rsquo;s how much I really didn&rsquo;t even care about it.<br />
		  She asked me, &ldquo;Oh did you ever  go get the exam?&rdquo; and I said &ldquo;No&rdquo;. So I said, &ldquo;I lost it,&rdquo; so she gave me a new  one and finally I was calling for a mammogram and all the hospitals asked me my  date of birth and as soon as I said 1988 they were like, &ldquo;Oh no sorry we don&rsquo;t  give mammograms to women under the age of 40.&rdquo; So again I was like that means  it must be nothing. I mean I&rsquo;m in my 20s, I&rsquo;ve got nothing to worry about if  they don&rsquo;t even give mammograms to women under the age of 40. So again I let  months pass and then I had to go see my doctor again and when she asked me, &ldquo;Did  you get the test done Nalie?&rdquo; and I said, &ldquo;No they were refusing me.&rdquo; She said,  &ldquo;Well how were they refusing you?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;No one gives mammograms to women  under 40.&rdquo; She said &ldquo;You&rsquo;re supposed to ask for an ultrasound,&rdquo; so I was so  na√Øve about it I didn&rsquo;t know, I didn&rsquo;t know anything about breast cancer and  how it worked. So finally that&rsquo;s the only time that I actually mentioned it to  my mom and I didn&rsquo;t want to mention it to my mom because mothers usually panic  and get stressed and get worried. So this is probably a year later, almost  10-11 months after finding the initial bumps on my breast that I told someone  about it aside from my family doctor.</p>
        <p>And then my mom made sure I got  that ultrasound done ASAP and so she even inquired with my sister-in-law who&rsquo;s  a nurse and she referred me to a clinic where I would have to pay to get an  ultrasound right away instead of waiting the 3 months at the hospital. </p>
