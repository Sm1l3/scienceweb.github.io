		<p>So I didn&rsquo;t see my doctor; he was on vacation. I saw a resident and I  was prescribed an ultrasound, which I had done in a radiology centre.Â  I had an ultrasound and I had insisted to  have a mammogram also, knowing that I was still breastfeeding at that time. I  was still breastfeeding my 2-year old daughter at the time. I had an  ultrasound, a mammogram and the radiologist did the ultrasound on the left  breast and he left. Then I called him back and told him: &ldquo;Listen, you forgot  the right breast.&rdquo; He came back and did the ultrasound on the right breast.  Everything is ok, it is a cyst. But I don&rsquo;t know, something inside me was  telling me: &ldquo;Go, get a second opinion.&rdquo; Because I left and was told: &ldquo;There is  nothing, those are only cysts.&rdquo; I went back to my family doctor, but he was on  vacation. So I went back to the doctor who prescribed the ultrasound, the  referral. He gave me the result and told me: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing, it&rsquo;s a cyst.&rdquo; And  all that. Then I said: &ldquo;Listen, I want a second opinion. I want to see a breast  specialist.&rdquo; So I was sent to another centre. I booked an appointment the week  after and the doctor that I saw there told me, after feeling the right breast,  &ldquo;Listen, what I am feeling there, it&rsquo;s hard, it&rsquo;s not a cyst.&rdquo;</p>
