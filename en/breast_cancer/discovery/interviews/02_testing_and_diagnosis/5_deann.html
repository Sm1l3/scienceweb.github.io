		<p>I had my first mammogram in  2009 and at time everything was ok. And then I also had the spot compression in  2009 and everything was okay. When I went back in 2010 and had the follow-up  mammogram a year later I got recalled for spot compression again and when I had  my spot compression in 2010, instead of doing the right side, they went and did  the left side and I kind of felt that there was some errors made in my diagnosis.  I just didnâ€™t bother to follow-up on it but I felt that in 2010, I should have  probably had the lumpectomy. I may have saved myself from having a mastectomy  because it just got bigger and bigger.</p>
