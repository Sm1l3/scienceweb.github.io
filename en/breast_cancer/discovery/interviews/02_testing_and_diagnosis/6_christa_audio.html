		<p>And then so 2 weeks later they  got the results back and they called me to say, &ldquo;Okay we&rsquo;ve got the results,  come in for them,&rdquo; and I&rsquo;m like okay well I guess I&rsquo;ll probably have to get a  mammogram today too you know just to make sure everything&rsquo;s okay. So I took a  pregnancy test because I knew they were going to ask me that question again and  it actually came up that I was pregnant. And that was at about 8 o&rsquo;clock in the  morning that I did it or9..So I had my doctor&rsquo;s appointment later on that day,  a few hours later and then I found out that they actually had found cancer, so  it was the same day.</p>
