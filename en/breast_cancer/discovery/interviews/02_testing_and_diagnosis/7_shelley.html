	  <p>So once that initial shock was over the next was the biopsy. The Breast  Cancer Clinic phoned almost immediately to have the biopsy. During that biopsy,  the doctor was having a hard time locating the lump it was so small. I believe  once the autopsy (results) came in it was 1.2 cm and that initial biopsy came  back benign. But what I knew was that as time was going on, and once it was  confirmed that the sensation, that tingling that I had when I was doing Reiki,  that initially kind of started this conversation, it started to become a burn.  I never did feel a lump but I always had a burn or an itch on my right breast  and it just seemed to intensify with every week as we were waiting and coming  up to this. So when the biopsy came back benign I had said that to the doctor  that I should be happy. I remember saying to her I should be happy. I&rsquo;m not  happy. (<strong style="font-weight:bold;">Added by Shelley after the  interview: </strong>The radiologist who performed the biopsy also indicated she  didn&rsquo;t think she located the lump because it was hard to locate. She strongly  suggested I ask for more tests too.)</p>
		<p>Because she said Merry  Christmas, Happy New Year it&rsquo;s benign and I said hmm something is wrong and I  listened to my body and I said that to her. I said, &ldquo;I need something more,&rdquo;  and she did thankfully book me in for an MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging ) which  happened about 2 weeks later and that did confirm ductal carcinoma throughout  my breast and one invasive carcinoma, ductal carcinoma that resulted in a  recommended mastectomy; and another biopsy, which they pinpointed right away  when I went in for the second biopsy. </p>
