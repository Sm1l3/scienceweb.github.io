		<p>And then all the things lined up and so with the mammogram they&rsquo;d seen  something suspicious and then they sent me for an ultrasound. And I was just  lucky that I had a senior ultrasound technician who realized that what she was  seeing was just different than what she&rsquo;s normally used to seeing. She wasn&rsquo;t  seeing a lump because I was diagnosed with mucinous cancer, which is a slimy  cancer that sort of spreads and so you don&rsquo;t get the lump. I did have another  component to my cancer but it was a smaller component so it was very, very  fortunate that I had an experienced ultrasound person who saw it. Because when  I was sent to the breast assessment unit at the hospital, the radiologist at  the time was going to try to do a biopsy and when he did the imaging he had a  really hard time seeing what she was pointing out on her imaging. </p>
		<p>So  that&rsquo;s when I was sent for an MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) and then with  the MRII lit up, my breast lit up like a light bulb because it was so diverse  and so spread out. And then I had to go back for a biopsy and then at that  point the radiologist had said, &ldquo;What we&rsquo;re doing now is trying to get the best  biopsy so we can confirm that it is cancer and you don&rsquo;t have to go through a  surgical biopsy.&rdquo; To try to miss one step. Which was hard at the time to hear, when  you go in, but I sort of had a gut feel that there was something wrong anyhow  so I did not know that this was going to happen like this so, I was alone. I  didn&rsquo;t have anybody with me I was just thinking I was going in for a biopsy. So  I think that what I learned, is if you start going through this process you  should have somebody with you at all times. Because it was really hard when he  said, &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re going to try to confirm that it is breast cancer.&rdquo; </p>
