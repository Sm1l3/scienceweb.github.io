		<p>I went to book an appointment,  however it took me a while, I think a month or a month and half to have a  biopsy and, following the biopsy, it took a while again to know the result.  They told me: &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s serious, if it&rsquo;s severe the doctor will call you the  first or the second week, but it will take three weeks to get a result.&rdquo; I am a  dental prosthetist. I was working and the doctor calls me from an anonymous  number: &ldquo;Good day Ms. [name].&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, speaking&rdquo; &ldquo;So, unfortunately you have  cancer. We will book you an appointment tomorrow to come to the hospital and  talk about the steps of the surgery and all.&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t find the words, but it  was difficult to learn such news by phone.</p>
