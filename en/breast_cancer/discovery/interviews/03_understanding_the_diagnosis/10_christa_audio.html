		<p>Well as far as my experience goes, it had run in my family and so I’d  gotten a couple of tests done just to see a baseline. I think I’d had one done  before and that was when I was about 34 years old. My mum had it when she was  45 and my grandma and all of my aunts had had it as well. So I kind of thought  that I would probably get it, but I didn’t think it would be for a long period  of time. But I thought I would just set a baseline up just so we would know  what my breast tissue was like and we would know what to look for. And then my  husband and I had started talking about maybe having kids, and so I thought I  should probably  get a test done just  because I knew that I wouldn’t be able to do that for a few years after I was  pregnant, and when I was breastfeeding, and that kind of thing. </p>
