		<p>I just think that everything is worse in your mind until it happens.  That’s why it’s so upsetting when you get a diagnosis of cancer because it’s  terrible and every stage of it is terrible. But then, when you’re actually  going through it, it’s just another step of it. It sucks but you get through  it. I’m not the first person in the world to have done chemo. I’m not the first  person to have had surgery. It’s manageable, you can get through it.</p>
