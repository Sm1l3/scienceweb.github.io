		<p>Will knowing the diagnosis change something? However, I know that the oncologist told me it was a hormone dependent cancer, which means I cannot take hormones. This I know, but the stage. But at some point, because I did not have metastasis, he said: “It is good for you.” Instead of having three hormone receptors negative, I only had two. There was one positive receptor and two negative ones. But the oncologist told me without me asking him, because I wasn’t familiar with this. He said: “In your case, yes it is good…” “What about my case? It is a cancer”. Today he probably knows how I lived through this and how it did happen for me. May be today he understands that I had no reaction because I was not there, I was in my bubble. But I learned little bits here and there, although the puzzle is not complete yet.</p>
