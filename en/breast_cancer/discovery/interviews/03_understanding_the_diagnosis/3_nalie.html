		<p>I think I was completely clueless about breast cancer and I think  that&rsquo;s a huge reason why I decided to make my story so public. With my blog, I  write about everything that I know about breast cancer and everything that I&rsquo;m  going through and take videos of what it&rsquo;s like, because as a 20 something year  old, you have no idea what it&rsquo;s like. The furthest campaigns go is to show you  pink ribbons and everything pink, and that&rsquo;s as far as awareness is brought. So  I wanted to really bring that type of awareness and make it raw and real  through my blog and my videos. Because as a 20 something year old you don&rsquo;t  know anything about breast cancer. And I will admit it, the first time my  surgeon and my oncologist read my diagnosis and read my pathology report and he  said, &ldquo;It was hormone positive estrogen, progesterone positive, HER2* (Human  Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor-2) negativeâ€¦&rdquo;, you hear that and it just  sounds like Chinese to you. You don&rsquo;t know what that means. Well obviously now,  having heard it over and over and over again, and asking questions, I&rsquo;m much  more aware of my diagnosis but still, it&rsquo;s not something that everyone knows.  If you don&rsquo;t study in the medical field, you don&rsquo;t really understand.</p>
		<p><em>*HER2: A gene present in cells that, in some breast cancer cases has a mutation. This mutation causes the HER2 gene to be overproduced in breast cells, causing cells to be more aggressive. However treatments that target HER2 are very effective.".</em></p>
