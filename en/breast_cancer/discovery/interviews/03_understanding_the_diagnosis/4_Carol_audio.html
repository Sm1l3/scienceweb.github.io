		<p>I did go on some websites but I tried to stick to the medical websites  to explain the stages, the size of the tumour, what that meant, and the lymph  nodes, etc. The doctors were very matter of fact. Breast cancer, right now, is  probably one of the better cancers to get because they&rsquo;ve done a lot of  research. There&rsquo;s a lot of women who&rsquo;ve undergone it, and so, as soon as I got  the diagnosis, they were like, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. This is what we&rsquo;re going to do.  We&rsquo;re going to do this, this and this.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s very clear and all of the way  through they were very positive. They&rsquo;re like, &ldquo;This is not a death sentence, and  this is curable. The success rate is fabulous, it&rsquo;s gotten better.&rdquo; Over the  years, it&rsquo;s increased and you can see by the stages what the success rates are  and what the survival rates are, etc. It&rsquo;s very well documented so I feel like  I&rsquo;m pretty well informed about what&rsquo;s going on, about what the protocol is,  what the success and survival rates are, and what needs doing. But always at  the back of my mind is the fact that it&rsquo;s 10 years that I have to be followed.  And if it comes back, it&rsquo;s usually worse. So even knowing how successful they  are at counteracting and fighting breast cancer, I&rsquo;m still scared at the back  of my mind that it&rsquo;ll come back. And I think I&rsquo;ll be scared for 10 years.</p>
