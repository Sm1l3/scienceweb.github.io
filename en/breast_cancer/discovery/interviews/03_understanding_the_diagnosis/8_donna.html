		<p>It has absolutely affected who I am. I realized that one of the things  is that I was a vegetarian for 25 years. I eat organic food, I do the 100-mile  diet, I meditate, I work with essential oils, and I thought I was really  healthy. I thought I was really doing good and that I was doing all the things  I needed (to do), maybe not all the things I needed but I thought I was doing  better. I thought I was good and then I realized that it didn&rsquo;t matter. And  then part of it is, I thought, &ldquo;Well, why would I think that I was the  exception to the rule?&rdquo; Why would I think that? I guess I thought it must have  been something I did or something I didn&rsquo;t do. That was the reason why I ended  up with breast cancer. I thought, &ldquo;Well what did I do wrong?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What did I  miss?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Why did I think that somebody else has done something wrong and they  would get breast cancer and I wouldn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; And so, it was realizing that there  was nothing. I wasn&rsquo;t any different than anybody else. My odds of getting  breast cancer were no different than your odds or my sister&rsquo;s odds or my  neighbour&rsquo;s odds. It&rsquo;s something that happens to us. It&rsquo;s a result of who knows  what? Is it environmental? Is it dietary? We don&rsquo;t know. We don&rsquo;t know what it  is but it&rsquo;s just realizing that there&rsquo;s nothing special about me.</p>
