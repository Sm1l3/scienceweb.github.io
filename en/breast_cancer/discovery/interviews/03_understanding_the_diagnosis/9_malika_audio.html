		<p>The diagnosis, I don’t know. I have known for quite a while that I was  going to have it. I don’t know why, because my mother had it at a young age.  There are a lot of breast cancers in my family, thus I knew I was going to get  it, but not at this time, six weeks after my mother’s death. It was too much at  the same time. What was difficulty for me was not the diagnosis, the cancer or  the grief, I didn’t know anymore. There were mixed feelings, but the cancer  itself didn’t frighten me.</p>
