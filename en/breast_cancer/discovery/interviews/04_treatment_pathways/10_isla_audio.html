		<p>What else, I would say that sometimes the  protocol that&rsquo;s in place, I&rsquo;ll give you an example. So women who take Herceptin  they&rsquo;re supposed to get MUGA scans* (Multi Gated Acquisition Scan) every 3  months while they&rsquo;re on it to monitor the ejection fraction from the left  ventricle of the heart. Well a MUGA scan is an injected dye, it&rsquo;s a nuclear  medicine test, so for someone who gets a blood test all the time and who gets  intravenous chemotherapy signing up for a MUGA scan after you&rsquo;ve had a bone  scan too is not something that you want to do. I decided I wanted to have  echocardiogram, which is a non-invasive ultrasound of the heart. So I got  scolded by a cardiologist because the error bar around the ejection fraction  that&rsquo;s determined from an echocardiogram is probably bigger, is bigger than the  change that they&rsquo;re trying to detect. But I accept that as okay, I know it&rsquo;s  not precise enough but I don&rsquo;t want another test and I don&rsquo;t want another  needle and I need for you to respect that, right. I understand that I&rsquo;ve given  up precision but what I&rsquo;ve gained is I don&rsquo;t have to have nuclear dye in my  veins every 3 months, right.<br />
</p>
		<p>So they have to kind of understand where  people are coming from on that even though I know the precision isn&rsquo;t there,  right. So it&rsquo;s not a good serial follow-up, I know. I made that decision thank  you.<br />
		  No he was upset with me and he continued to  say &ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t be doing this&rdquo; I&rsquo;m like &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re not going to see a 2%  change you can only see a 5% change I&rsquo;m willing to accept that, right.&rdquo; Because  the biggest changes are coming usually in elderly women, usually in people with  pre-existing conditions. I don&rsquo;t have any of those so the so-called risk to me  of the test is bigger than the lack of precision by the choice that I made in  my view. And he, that&rsquo;s my viewpoint on it and it&rsquo;s not an unformed viewpoint,  it is a lay viewpoint but it&rsquo;s not an uninformed viewpoint and it is a valid  viewpoint.</p>
		<p>* MUGA  scan: Scan that creates video imagery of the hearts ventricles to check for  abnormalities and to ensure that they are pumping blood properly.</p>
