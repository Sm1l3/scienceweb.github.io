		<p><strong>Interviewer: </strong>When you had the mastectomy did you have your reconstruction straightaway or was it after?</p>
        <p>No I didn’t want it. I didn’t want it and it’s funny because the doctor left a lot of tissue thinking that I would so it’s not the prettiest sight, but it doesn’t bother (my husband) any and that’s all that matters, right? Yeah, So this side (of the chest) there’s nothing, this side there’s some tissue. </p>
        <p>And he said “Oh, I thought for sure you’d want to have reconstructive surgery.” I said “no way I don’t want to go, I don’t want to be put to sleep again ever, ever, ever.” So he just said “well I could clean it all up and make it all the same.” I said “no, I’m fine I’ll just deal with it, yeah.”</p>
        <p><strong>Interviewer: </strong>Did you try a prosthesis?</p>
        <p>I have yeah.</p>
        <p><strong>Interviewer: </strong>Did you feel comfortable?</p>
        <p>Yep, Oh yeah</p>
