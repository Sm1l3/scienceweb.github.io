		<p>It would have been good if I had, if I&rsquo;d had  the knowledge. A little bit more knowledge about mesh, how mesh works in your  body. I guess really, I should have researched it more, but actually at the  time that I went down there, I wasn&rsquo;t aware that I was going to get mesh in my  body. I think that was â€¦ the reason I opted for the TRAM flap*(Transverse  Rectus Abdominis Muscle Flap) surgery was because I didn&rsquo;t want foreign  material in my body. I thought this would be my breasts built from my own body  rather than anything foreign put in there. So that was a huge thing on my part,  that I should have really researched this more. So I would say that do your  research, look at different sites, talk to different people. I had talked to  one woman who had the TRAM flap done and she was very happy with what had  happened. <br />
</p>
		<p>Now another thing also, I forgot to mention,  I said I had decided to do this because I didn&rsquo;t want any foreign products in  my body but when I went back for the second surgery my breasts were not, the  right breast was wonderful it looks real, it feels real it&rsquo;s perfect. The left  breast was just a little lump and I said to the, this is done in Toronto, and I  said to the doctor there, that well,&quot; But they&rsquo;re so different. I mean  they&rsquo;re not this isn&rsquo;t breasts, this isn&rsquo;t a breast.&rdquo; She said &ldquo;We can make the  other one smaller or we can make the left one to match the right one. I said  well I want breasts, I don&rsquo;t want little lumps. I didn&rsquo;t go through all this to  have little lumps.&rdquo; And she says &ldquo;Well the only way we can give you a left  breast is to put in an implant.&rdquo; So here I resisted or I should say here I was  trying to think, trying to or thinking that my breast would be built from my  own body and now I have an implant anyway because they, they, she said there  was no other way to give me a left breast. And I think they should have been  told to me right away. I don&rsquo;t think that it should have been an afterthought  and when she put the implant in first of all, it was too big and she put it too  high. So then I had to go back so that she could lower the implant. I kind a  got fooled on that one because I said &ldquo;Now I have, I have mesh in my body plus  I have an implant in my body and that&rsquo;s not what I was expecting.&rdquo;</p>
