		<p>I’m, it’s not all of them for sure and not  all oncologists for sure and not all nurses, but it’s a, it requires a huge  culture change and it doesn’t just require a culture change on the part of the  healthcare provider, it requires a culture change on the part of patients. You  need to be responsible for your care. So if you are ill, you need to do  something about it and then you need to share in the care and the treatment if  that happens. For cancer patients that’s extraordinarily important. People have  the right to refuse chemotherapy, they have the right to refuse radiation if  they want to. It may not always be the sensible choice but the point is they  have the right to do it. What the, what the healthcare providers need to do, is  to make sure that the patient and family has the information they need to go  ahead and make their decision and then to help them make that decision, to make  the right decision and to make it through. I know people who have refused chemotherapy  when it was recommended; again that’s a personal choice. You have to decide.  That it’s, some people look at it as, as toxic. It is toxic. Radiation is  toxic, nobody was meant to have that kind of radiation put in their body but  it’s better than dying because that’s the alternative as far as I look at it.</p>
