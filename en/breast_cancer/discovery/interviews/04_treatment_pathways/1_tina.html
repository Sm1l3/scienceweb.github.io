		<p>The process was fine because I knew what I  had to do for me. I find that some of them are very, very pushy that you need  to do this, this, and this and this and it leaves you with nowhere to go for yourself.  Like I find that, I just found that they weren&rsquo;t leaving an opening for me to  decide for myself. I thought it was pretty crazy for them to not allow me to  decide what I wanted for my body. Like it&rsquo;s my body and I said &ldquo;Well this is  what I&rsquo;m going to do&rdquo;, I mean they talked, and talked, and talked and tried to  convince me and it was just no, no it does not feel right for me. Intuitively I  went with my intuition and with how I was feeling about it, not the pressure  from the doctors to get me to do what they thought was best for me.</p>
        <p>It&rsquo;s tremendous pressure and people don&rsquo;t  understand that they can, it&rsquo;s their choice no matter what anybody, any of the  doctors says, it&rsquo;s still your choice. It&rsquo;s your body, it&rsquo;s your decision, when  it comes right down to it and that&rsquo;s, I was very, very strong in that and it  was the same with the double mastectomy. Like &quot;Are you sure you want to do  this? Do you want to have the breast removed there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with the  other breast.&quot; And I said &quot;Yes, I&rsquo;ve made that decision and I want  them both off.&quot; </p>
