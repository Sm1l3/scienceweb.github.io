		<p>That was like a whole, after finally, so what  was it January, February, March 21st I had the surgery and then four weeks later I  was in Ottawa for an egg retrieval. And that was, so much had to come together  during that four week period. Because we were waiting for so long for, I had  the surgery in March and then the pathology didn’t come back until weeks later.  Then finally when the pathology was back it showed it was in one lymph node  which meant definitely that yes, I would be needing chemotherapy and radiation  and the whole shebang. And so, as soon as I found out that chemo was a thing, I  knew I’d have to do the egg retrieval, and all that had to happen in one day.  It was one Friday where I saw the medical oncologist and then because of where  my cycle was and stuff. I had to start the fertility drugs and prepare for the  egg retrieval so as to not delay the start of chemotherapy and that was another  really hard day. It was really hard on the day when I found out I need chemo  and I need to start the fertility drugs today before four o’clock and that was  at like three o’clock so it was, that was hard.</p>
