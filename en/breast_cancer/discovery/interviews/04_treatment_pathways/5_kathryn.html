		<p><strong>Interviewer: </strong>So  when your cancer came back you didn&rsquo;t have chemo and radiation as well?</p>
        <p>No they just took the whole breast off. I  said forget it this, I should have done it in 2003. All those four surgeries, I  should have listened and I should have taken the whole thing off, but again, I  was vain at that time. I didn&rsquo;t want to have a mastectomy, I really didn&rsquo;t and  I was adamant that I didn&rsquo;t, so that&rsquo;s it. But, but I really do believe that if  I had had a mammogram and an ultrasound and maybe radiation on my breast I  wouldn&rsquo;t have had to have a mastectomy, but it&rsquo;s in the cards it is what it is.  You know what, I got very upset with myself, I made a very big deal about a  mastectomy, it really bothered me and because I blamed the doctor and I was  pissed off that I listened to the doctor. A friend of mine, I remember, I went  to the support group once and she told me she had done her scan and her cancer  was in her head. And I said to myself &ldquo;How could you complain about losing a  breast when my friend is worried about losing her life?&rdquo; And I actually wrote  my doctor a letter and I apologized.Â  I  said &quot;I made a big deal&quot; I said &quot;It&rsquo;s only a breast.&quot; And  that&rsquo;s why the doctors treat you, to them breasts are nothing you can lose a  breast you&rsquo;re not going to lose a life and it&rsquo;s true the least of your problems  are your boobs and you realize that.</p>
