		<p>I think giving patients a choice goes a long  way. So even if it&rsquo;s not, not necessarily a yes or no choice but in certain  circumstances that&rsquo;s not always the case. Sometimes with children, they just  need to know that they can make a decision and you don&rsquo;t ask them if they want  toast with peanut butter you say &ldquo;do you want toast with peanut butter or do  you want toast with jam?&rdquo; and giving them... you&rsquo;re still going to have toast  but which way would you kind of like to have it? And I think that patients feel  a bit more involved in their treatment if they&rsquo;re given those kind of choices  especially when it comes to something like this.</p>
		<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m not sure that we&rsquo;re there yet  but, I think that there&rsquo;s definitely, there&rsquo;s definitely some little strides  that physicians can make with respect and to providing patients with options  and choices.<br />
	    </p>
		<p>Well like the port versus the pick. Having  something hanging from your arm is a little bit uncomfortable and it&rsquo;s, it  needs to be kept sanitary and all of these things whereas maybe the port is a  bit more invasive but it gives the client or the patient a little bit more freedom  in how they&rsquo;re accessed or how they can maintain their lifestyle. Maybe for  some people having a pick isn&rsquo;t conducive maybe they swim and they can&rsquo;t get it  wet and all those kinds of things. So I think just taking into consideration  the differences in patients, sometimes is instead of having one kind of linear  approach, to be able to give patients choices within options where it&rsquo;s  possible.</p>
