		<p>Okay HER2 *(Human Epidermal Growth Factor  Receptor-2) is an elevated protein that usually means that the cancer is a  little bit more aggressive and there&rsquo;s a drug called Herceptin and now there&rsquo;s  a whole bunch of other drugs that are available for HER2-positive patients. So  I pushed because I was 0.02 off of being considered HER2-positive and so again,  I had to push because again you need to know about the sensitivity of how these  tests are done and it wasn&rsquo;t a hard stretch to say &ldquo;What harm will it do to  give a very healthy woman like Herceptin or a HER2 agent?&rdquo; And so, then I  pushed to have HER2 Herceptin, for my HER2 and did that for 18 sessions which  took about a year and 3 months and then again with HER2 or Herceptin, I should  say and a lot of the agents that are used when you&rsquo;re HER2-positive they can  cause cardiovascular issues.<br />
</p>
		<p>And that was the other thing is that, there&rsquo;s  two different tests that you can have to test your heart functions. One&rsquo;s a  MUGA and it&rsquo;s used with radioisotopes and the other one is just an imaging like  an ultrasound. They had done a MUGA which is the one with the…They inject dye  into you and that one had said one number and then the other procedure a little  later on had shown that my heart function had dropped. And so the heart  function they say is or they utilize the term ejection fraction and if you drop  more than 20% on your ejection fraction you need basically, to stop the drug.  But again my oncologist wanted to take me completely off of it and not restart  me and I had only had 5-6 treatments. In everything I had read if you can get  the full treatment it&rsquo;s better for you. Again I had to go back to the Internet.  I actually had to pull the Herceptin guidelines, Canadian Herceptin Guidelines  and show them to her which is if you have somebody whose heart function drops  then you have to stop them for 6 weeks and then reinitiate them. That&rsquo;s the  protocol. If I wouldn&rsquo;t have pushed for that I wouldn&rsquo;t have had the full dose  of Herceptin. Would it have made a difference now that I&rsquo;m metastatic, I don&rsquo;t  know but the fact is that we know that it could have made a lot, I mean I think,  I personally believe it would have been a lot worse if I didn&rsquo;t get the full  dose. But again having the knowledge and not being afraid to stand up for what  you want and that&rsquo;s basically what I did is I went toe-to-toe to the Head  Oncologist when I went in for Herceptin and he was going to deny it for me and  so I, again, it was a fight but was it a valid fight, yes. <br />
		  </p>
		<p>So again I think huge learnings for  healthcare people. It&rsquo;s all about cost but I think it&rsquo;s something that needs to  be pushed. I think as a patient you need to be aware of some of these options  that you can track and not to be so trusting in everything that they say. I  don&rsquo;t mean to be sceptical or cynical it&rsquo;s just that they&rsquo;re people who put  their pants on one leg at a time and they can make mistakes too and you&rsquo;re the  only person who&rsquo;s going to look after you. I find here in the province we don&rsquo;t  have many options. We can&rsquo;t really go to another cancer agency, we have one, so  sometimes you need to fight the system more than you need to do anything else. </p>
