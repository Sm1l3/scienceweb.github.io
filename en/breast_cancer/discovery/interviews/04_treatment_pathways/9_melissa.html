		<p>So like I said, my mom, because of the  success that my mom had had, she was almost 10 years cancer free before she was  diagnosed with a recurrence. I felt like, that maybe, it was a bit excessive to  do that. And so, in my discussions with my physician and kind of… my thought  process… I kind of looked at some literature and speaking with some other  healthcare professionals, I decided that I would rather while, I was younger  and stronger, try to tackle any remaining cells in an aggressive way so that I  didn&rsquo;t have to deal with it when I was older. That was kind of my approach  because my surgeon had told me, she said &quot;well 15 years ago or so if you  had your diagnosis you wouldn&rsquo;t be recommended to do chemotherapy but the  research was showing that there was higher incidences of recurrence in similar  cases between women who did chemotherapy and women who didn&rsquo;t.&quot;</p>
		<p>	    Well, both of my aunts went into remission,  then they both had recurrences and they had had chemotherapy. I was a bit torn  because here it is, these women did kind of what they were supposed to do and  it wasn&rsquo;t necessarily the best option for them at the time. But what I just  kept reminding myself was that every single person in every case, despite many  similarities, there are always still many different factors that come into  play. I just had to decide what was going to be best for me. I kind of had a short-term  pain for long-term gain approach. I think was probably one of the thoughts that  went through my mind. If I do this now it&rsquo;s preventative and as we move forward  I don&rsquo;t want to say that I&rsquo;m never going to get a recurrence but it will lower  my chances of recurrence. So I think that that&rsquo;s probably that went into it for  sure. </p>
		<p>	    From that appointment I took away that  information and did a bit more research and chatted with a few more people and  I was able to come to the conclusion on my own. But I&rsquo;d have to say I wasn&rsquo;t  afraid to, I wasn&rsquo;t afraid to tell somebody, to tell a physician that that  wasn&rsquo;t my decision. So I think that it was really important that I just kept up  the fact that it was my treatment like and I just stayed with that approach.  Like yes, I&rsquo;m their patient but it&rsquo;s my treatment and it&rsquo;s my body and so I  just kind of kept that in my back pocket and they had, like they had, I went to  the appointment and they already had me scheduled for my first chemo treatment.  They had me scheduled for all of these different things and I was just kind of  like &ldquo;I need some breathing.&rdquo; I need to breathe for a minute. In the course of  that period of time I was able to do the research that came to, that helped me  come to my conclusion.</p>
