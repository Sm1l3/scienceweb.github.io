		<p>I’m a mom. I have a full-time job. I have a spouse who sometimes doesn’t understand things and there’s a lot of other women or other caregivers who are in similar situations and I think that it’s really important that we all understand where everybody’s coming from. Especially because there is a tendency for women to want to do it all, be it all and there’s a... I think it’s a picture. There’s a picture of a woman with chemotherapy, who’s a cancer patient and she’s carrying the groceries and carrying a baby and you can see her kind of spiky hair. It’s a cartoon stick figure type thing, and she’s running after the dog and then it says ‘mom with breast cancer.’ And then the other picture’s ‘dad with a cold’ and it’s in bed. I think that the stigma for women to continue to have to do it all is still there and I think that it’s really important that we recognize that we don’t have to. I did still work but that was by choice that was a, that wasn’t an "I need to do everything" it was a normalcy thing for me. It was trying to stay on target for that. But I did want to share because I think it’s important that people can have different… have different perspective on the disease and how it impacted them.</p>
