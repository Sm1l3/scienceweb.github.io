		<p>One thing that I did, I had a friend who was a psychologist and she said if I wanted to that I could come to see her and she would help me with the meditation. She walked me through a meditation to do. I could do it any day but especially to do before I went to my chemo. I did that religiously before my chemo and quite often in between and maybe a shorter version. And I found that was really helpful and even once in a while now, over the years, if I’ve felt a little bit vulnerable I’ll go and do that and feel it’s getting rid of any of the bad stuff that’s in my body. Giving me good stuff, and that works, I forgot about that but that was really a powerful thing for me.</p>
