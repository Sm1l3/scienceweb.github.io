		<p>I went through a lot of fear about the dying. That was pretty scary. At one point, when I, at the point where I was still gaining the knowledge and then still having not consulted with the BC (British Columbia) Cancer Agency, when I wasn’t sure "Am I going to die from this." It wasn’t until after June of June 5th 2009 with the consultation, then I felt better and they were saying once you’re done the treatment 80% cured. And so, I was asking... and they never used the remission. I don’t know if that’s not used so much anymore but when people ask "Oh! so are you cured?" And I said "Well my cure rate is 80% I’m pretty happy with that."</p>
