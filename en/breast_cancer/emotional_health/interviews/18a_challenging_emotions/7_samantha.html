		<p>Well thinking about death, I very quickly got my stuff sorted out. Even just financial things looking at insurance policies and that kind of thing. That, my husband was not interested in at all. But for me, that made me feel better, I felt like I was prepared. I got copies of the wills printed, those kinds of things. I think my husband thought that was morbid but I felt that was practical. And again, it was something I could actually do. But has it changed my life? For sure.  I often think now, I’ve only been back to work about 8 months now but nobody died today. I hope, I keep that perspective because it’s pretty easy to get worked up about things that in the grander scheme of things are probably not the most important. </p>
