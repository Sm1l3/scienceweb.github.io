It’s not that I couldn’t say no before and it’s not that I wasn’t full of ideas but I think that I’m more assertive I guess. I think I am more assertive for the things that are important.

I have more stick to it for what I think. Rather than saying this might be a good idea, I’m saying it is a good idea we’re going to do it. So I think that way, I might be different I don’t know... you’d probably have to ask other people.</p>
