		<p>How many people would say living with what I’ve gone through is a positive experience, but for me it has been, it has been. It’s allowed me to grow and be a better person. I would say I’m a more giving person, kinder person than I was. I stop and smell the flowers more. Last year was my first year in this apartment. I live in a place where there’s tons and tons of maple trees and I’ve started picking up maple leaves everywhere different ones. I’d bring them to the doorman and I would put them on the counter and they thought it was whacked but I didn’t care. I experience, every season is a bonus for me and I enjoy it and I make sure that every day is a good day.</p>
