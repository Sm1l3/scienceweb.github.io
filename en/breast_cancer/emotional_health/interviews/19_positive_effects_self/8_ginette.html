		<p>But I believe that it completely changes a person, it changes your attitude towards life. The little pieces of happiness, what I call the little pieces of happiness, sometimes it is not much. Before I didn’t see them but now I do. The neighbor that comes here, that comes to talk to us, she is 4 years old, she is so funny, she is nice. I gave her a flower one day, she comes back to thank us and it was so funny! You know the little pieces of happiness that I didn’t even see before, but now, today, you are more focused on the current moment because you know that your life is fragile. You know that… Still I am, I will be 64. You are more focused on living, I would say, intensely. This is very important.</p>
