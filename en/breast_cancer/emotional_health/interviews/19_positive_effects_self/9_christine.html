		<p>My friends tell me that I’m much more laidback now which is a good thing. I have changed foundationally through this. I can start to tell you I don’t think the change is quite finished. I am beginning to appreciate my limitations, my humanness. There is not a great sort of enthusiastic well let’s go conquer the world. It’s okay, it’s all right, life is okay. I think that for me is the change. I was never a fearful kind of person and now I really am not. If I die today it’s okay, if I die next week it’s okay, if I die in three years that’s fine, if I die in 20 that’s also okay. And I say this with an honesty and not a fatalistic kind of "Oh God!" But it’s okay.</p>
