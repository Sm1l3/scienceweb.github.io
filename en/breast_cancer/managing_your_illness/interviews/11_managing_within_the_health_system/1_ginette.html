		<p>Did I lose faith? I don&rsquo;t know what to tell you because I am  a little mixed up. Because they almost gave me an insulin shot although I am  not diabetic, trusting is difficult. I am more on the defensive now. In  general, I am very sincere when I say: &ldquo;Do not leave a person alone, whether at  the emergency, whether in outpatient consultation, wherever.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s it, I  found it not easy.  Not easy! The care?  Well as for the care it depends on who is there. The oncologist, I didn&rsquo;t… She  is fantastic. The chemo treatment went well. But it wasn&rsquo;t their fault if they  were late! These are technical elements. Sometimes, it&rsquo;s a machine that is out  of order. Things like that happen. I  don&rsquo;t blame them for this.</p></div>
