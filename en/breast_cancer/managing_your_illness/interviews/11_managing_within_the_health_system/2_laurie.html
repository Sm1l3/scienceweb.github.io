		<p>So the normal course of events would be that then I’d go for  6months of chemotherapy and because I had one node positive they wanted to also  do radiation, both on the breast area and on the supraclavicular area here. But  I didn’t like the sound of that either and we’re really starting to get into  the era of personalized medicine where they can look more at the genetic makeup  of your tumour to decide whether chemotherapy is beneficial or not. And  currently in Quebec, if you have no nodes positive, they will allow you to get  the Oncotype DX* test which tests your genetic components in your tumour and  then based on your Oncotype results you can see whether it’s beneficial or not  to do the chemotherapy. But as soon as you have a node positive you’re not  automatically entitled to that but I found a doctor who was willing to order it  for me anyway. And then when I got the results back, it turns out that my Oncotype  score was 18, which is right at the boundary of low risk and intermediate risk,  so being an optimist I would say it’s at the top of low risk . And actually  there were twolines and they intersected at exactly my score so one line was  Tamoxifen + chemotherapy; the other line was just Tamoxifen and I was bang on  the intersection.</p>
