		<p>I’m on the Patient &amp; Family Advisory Council at  Cancer Care Ontario as well as for the Regional Cancer Centre here. In Canada  we’re behind with patient-centred care. Somehow over the years we’ve given over  our care entirely to healthcare providers and that’s not right, it shouldn’t  happen entirely. Yes they’re trained, they know better but I know my body as  well as anybody and I want a say in how my medical journey goes wherever it is.  I’ve always had that with my family physician, she respects people. I think  that hasn’t always happened. It certainly doesn’t happen in the medical  profession always. it’s not all of them for sure,  not all oncologists and not all nurses, but  it requires a huge culture change and it doesn’t just require a culture change on  the part of the healthcare provider, it requires a culture change on the part  of patients. You need to be responsible for your care, so if you are ill you  need to do something about it and then you need to share in the care and the  treatment if that happens and for cancer patients that’s extraordinarily  important. People have the right to refuse chemotherapy, they have the right to  refuse radiation if they want to. It may not always be the sensible choice but  the point is they have the right to do it. What the healthcare providers need  to do is to make sure that the patient and family has the information they need  to go ahead and make their decision and then to help them make that decision,  to make the right decision and to make it through. I know people who have  refused chemotherapy when it was recommended, and again that’s a personal  choice. Some people look at it as toxic. It is toxic. Radiation is toxic and  nobody was meant to have that kind of radiation put in their body but it’s  better than dying because that’s the alternative as far as I look at it.</p>
