		<p>I think most of the  healthcare are good peopleâ€”I mean obviously they&rsquo;re into healthcare and they&rsquo;re  doing their job because they care about helping people,  right and they&rsquo;re doing their best in the current system to do that. But I  think it&rsquo;s time to rethink the system a little bit and to give some of the  power back to the patient and don&rsquo;t underestimate what the patient can do and  understand. So people will someone say, &ldquo;Okay Laurie, I see that you&rsquo;re getting  the information and you made good use of it, and you understand it but most of  my patients wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t believe that actually. I think that there&rsquo;s  quite a bit of information that could be given to the patient, especially if it&rsquo;s  personalized to their situation that would be very beneficial to them. And even  if they didn&rsquo;t understand it on the spot during the appointment, being able to  take it home, show it to their family members, and think about it for a while.  I think just having their own personal information, pictures of their tumour,  pictures of their radiation, their latest blood test results, a graph showing  their weight, because they&rsquo;re really concerned if you have cancer if your  weight&rsquo;s going down.</p>
