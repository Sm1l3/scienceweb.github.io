		<p>Bless their hearts they&rsquo;re so sweet,  but I&rsquo;m a Type 1 diabetic and one of the things that I discovered is that  disciplines don&rsquo;t talk to each other so I sat in the chemo session and I said  well I&rsquo;m a Type 1 diabetic, what am I supposed to do? And so okay we&rsquo;ll talk to  the dieticians and the dieticians said &ldquo;You need to talk to your diabetic  people&rdquo;. So, information session on the 27th or 26th of  November, 27th of November round one of chemo. Within 24 hours I was  on my back with the leg pains, nausea, started the recovery in my apartment and  ended up at my mother&rsquo;s place on my back. And just for the luck of it I&rsquo;d had  an appointment made with my diabetic specialist on the Monday just to talk  about what the heck do you do in terms of feeding. Literally my mother and her  friend had to gather me up and put me into the car and take me there. </p>
        <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Because you were so  unwell? <br />
          </p>
        <p>I was so unwell. My diabetic specialist took one look at me  and she said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not doing very good are you?&rdquo; I said &ldquo;No&rdquo;, she said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re  dehydrated, you&rsquo;ve got thrush, you&rsquo;re going into the hospital.&rdquo;</p>
