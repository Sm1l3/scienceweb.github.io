		<p>That was funny, my first mammogram visit. I get they have to  go through all those questions .Of course now I&rsquo;m going all the time, every 6  months or I think it&rsquo;s only once/year now. Anyway they have to go through all  those questions in the beginning and the poor technician at one point she said,  &ldquo;So do you have any other breast complaints today?&rdquo; and I said, &ldquo;Besides the  fact that I only have one?&rdquo; And she was very taken aback because I just try to  make light of it. That&rsquo;s what works with me and they still have to go through  all the questions every time and I&rsquo;m going really? </p>
&rsquo;t know they  could change some of that to make it more personable. That&rsquo;s one thing I find  the medical field, the breast cancer, I mean the mammogram questions is a prime  example. If you go, I know for a normal woman you have to ask all those  questions as part of your protocol. You have to have your checks in your boxes  but if you&rsquo;re looking at somebody who only has one breast or somebody who&rsquo;s  gone through breast cancer you can tick some of those off yourself without having  to ask. I&rsquo;m a pretty comfortable, confident person but anybody who&rsquo;s really  emotional or sensitive to the breast cancer or how it&rsquo;s left them and there are  a lot out there who are really sensitive. </div>
