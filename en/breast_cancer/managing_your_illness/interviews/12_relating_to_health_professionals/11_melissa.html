		<p>I think giving patients a  choice goes a long way. Even if it&rsquo;s not necessarily a yes or no choice but in  certain circumstances that&rsquo;s not always the case. Sometimes with children, they  just need to know that they can make the decision and you don&rsquo;t ask them if  they want toast with peanut butter you say &ldquo;Do you want toast with peanut  butter or do you want toast with jam?&rdquo; And giving them that choiceâ€¦you&rsquo;re still  going to have toast but which way would you kind of like to have it? I think  that patients feel a bit more involved in their treatment if they&rsquo;re given those  kind of choices especially when it comes to something like this.</p>
