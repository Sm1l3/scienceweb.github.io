		<p>There’s a level of comfort there  that I would always find in that. But the compassion and the empathy was second  to none throughout my journey and when I did encounter somebody who maybe was  having a bad day for whatever reason it was tough. I found that really tough on  the recovery road and nobody’s perfect. Nobody, I’m not perfect nobody’s  perfect, but whether it is, I guess it doesn’t matter what the patient is  diagnosed with or dealing with to have the healthcare providers know that we  want to get better too. We don’t want to be lingering in your offices or on the  hospital wards or anywhere else. But we just don’t know and it becomes, again,  patience and understanding and that compassion to help; to help us and allow us  to help them in treating us. So patience would be is a virtue we’ll leave it at  that.</p>
