		<p>I think treating each woman as  an individual, being able to take the time to spend with the woman, being  caring, being patient, understanding. I always appreciate if I feel like the  doctor or the healthcare person has time for me that isn’t rushed, that isn’t  rushing off to do something else. Being willing to listen to my questions and  concerns and things like that, even if they’re very trivial but at the moment,  maybe they aren’t for myself. I like to know the facts, I want to know, I don’t  want anyone to sugar-coat anything, I want to know how it is, what to look for  and what’s ahead of me. I guess the honesty.</p></div>
