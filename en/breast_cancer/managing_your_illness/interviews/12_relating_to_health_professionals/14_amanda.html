		<p>I don’t know if it’s advice but  just for the patient repeating histories of your family and your progression of  your illness it’s an emotional thing and it’s hard. So if there’s any way you  can read the chart and get some information before you go in there, and not  have to ask the person to take it from the top every single time when they have  2 to 3 appointments a day. Do that. Just try and know what you can know before  you go in there, even if it takes some time. I don’t mind waiting, sometimes it  sucks, but waiting isn’t that bad. I’d rather, if it saves me having to repeat  that &quot;Everyone in my family had cancer!&quot; Then that would be nice if  you could read up on that. And that’s one thing. Also, for pre-menopausal women  who get diagnosed with cancer and who are facing risks with their fertility,  let them know that there’s options. We can’t do it here in (an Atlantic  province ) and it’s expensive but there is stuff that you can do. So just  broach that head-on and don’t wait for them to come to you looking for the  information. I think that’s really important.</p>
