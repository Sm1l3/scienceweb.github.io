		<p>I am lucky to have a medical  team that listens. My surgeon was the first to give me my diagnosis and I  always had a nice relationship with him. He is available to answer my questions  and this from the start. So first, I consider myself very lucky for this. And  secondly, I feel confident. And to trust your healthcare team is one of the  first things I can suggest to someone. If you are not confident, do some  research to find people you can trust. By recommendations. I had my oncologist  through my surgeon, as well as my radio oncologist. So a team that was sharing was  created around me. I knew that if there was some questioning concerning what  was happening with me, they would talk together. Because they were telling me:  &ldquo;Ah! I will talk to your doctor.&rdquo; Or &ldquo;I will talk to him.&rdquo; Or &ldquo;I think he  should look at this.&rdquo; So to know that there is a team working around you, that  you are the focus and that they listen to you, it was essential for me. I was  lucky to have that, and to still have that, yes. Also the nursing teams in the  hospitals are much available and really listen. The psychologist that is  following me also. All these aspects bring confidence towards your medical  team.</p>
