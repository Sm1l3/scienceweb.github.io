		<p>The other thing isâ€¦ what I did is,  I put a great big picture of my son on and I had a binder, like a notebook and  I put it in the front. And when I got questioned about why I was doing  something, or I got the sense that they weren&rsquo;t understanding, I&rsquo;d open to the  picture to my son and I said &ldquo;He needs a mom and this is why we&rsquo;re doing it.&rdquo; And  you humanize it. I&rsquo;m not an old woman, I am not ready to die and I am not going  to leave him without a mom. So now, let&rsquo;s have this conversation again. It&rsquo;s  not what I said, but it came across that way and they need to understand  there&rsquo;s human. It&rsquo;s not just these lab results and this person who&rsquo;s sitting  there, they&rsquo;re thinking &ldquo;They&rsquo;re hypochondriac.&rdquo; And I know, she said to me,  she got a call from the radiologist that said &ldquo;Why am I doing the biopsy again?&rdquo;  Because they biopsied the same node but she was still okay with sending me for  the biopsy because that&rsquo;s what she knew that I needed and it was okay. And I  know she tried to make me feel bad. I just sort of said &quot;Well now we know  for sure it was reactive don&rsquo;t we and that makes me feel a lot better. I know  you didn&rsquo;t believe in it but it takes the 95% and takes it down a little bit  more.&rdquo; So she was okay with that.</p></div>
