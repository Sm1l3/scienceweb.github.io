		<p>And always, I went into my  appointment with a friend and before the appointment, I say &ldquo;Okay I want this,  this and this discussed with my oncologist could you please make sure that  these things come up if I forget.&rdquo; Because when you&rsquo;re in there and you&rsquo;re discussing  it, there&rsquo;s a lot of stuff that might be being thrown at you and so it&rsquo;s nice  to have, again type A personality, a plan. Write your questions down. If you  find that you&rsquo;re oncologist is trying to rush you through it, make him stop.  Make him stop, that is your time with him and no question is silly, no request  is silly they need to hear what you have to say. You need to build that rapport  with them and stuff like that. You obviously do everything respectfully. I  don&rsquo;t believe in being rude or obnoxious or yelling or anything like that but  there&rsquo;s a difference between doing it forcefully and getting what you need, and  doing it disrespectfully. I don&rsquo;t… you&rsquo;re not going to get anywhere with the  other one. But I&rsquo;ve never had any issues with just saying I don&rsquo;t… I told her,  I said &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I don&rsquo;t I know, you feel comfortable with that but I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p></div>
