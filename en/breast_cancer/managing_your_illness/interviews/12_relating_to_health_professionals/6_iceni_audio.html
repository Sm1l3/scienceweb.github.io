		<p>I feel very strongly about that  but I feel very strongly that women should have a voice in their treatment. They  should know more in everything. They should know and not be afraid to ask the  doctors questions. They&rsquo;re not Gods, they might act like some of them superior  but they&rsquo;re not. No! So they do intimidate people especially when you&rsquo;re sick.  And you don&rsquo;t want them to be bothered or you&rsquo;re scared to ask. So I would  advise breast cancer, or any cancer patients, to have a family member or good  friend always with them so they can hear or tape record it. But always have  somebody to say &ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t feel well.&rdquo; You&rsquo;re too sick, you want to get  somebody else to get in bad with the doctor rather than you get another needle.  It&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying, you don&rsquo;t want to piss the doctor off, so you&rsquo;re not  going to ask questions that you think might be irrelevant or whatever. So if  you&rsquo;ve got somebody with you, like a daughter or a friend, to say &ldquo;Well she has  to know.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s not afraid to ask.</p></div>
