		<p>When I went in, the doctor examined and she had two students. They  examined me too, she let them there was  one Indian doctor, who was an intern I think, and another one, a white one. And  they didâ€¦ they asked me can, I touch and I said &ldquo;Yes you are all learning the  job so it&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo; So I was on the table and they touched and whatnot. But,  they were a bit shy. They&rsquo;re young. I say &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s okay, you go ahead, this is  part of your job.&rdquo; Then the doctor, she told me &ldquo;Really it&rsquo;s cancer&quot;. And I said &ldquo;Okay&rdquo; Because, I had a thing  before in my brain. Maybe it&rsquo;s cancer from the lump, for myself. I tell  myself maybe that&rsquo;s what they call cancer. I didn&rsquo;t know exactly because a lump,  they were asking me if I see any discharge from my nipples; nothing at all,  nothing at all.</p>
