		<p>So I didn&rsquo;t see my doctor; he was on vacation. I saw a resident and I  was prescribed an ultrasound, which I had done in a radiology centre. I had an  ultrasound and I had insisted to have a mammogram also, knowing that I was still  breastfeeding at the time. I was still breastfeeding my two-year old daughter  at the time. I had an ultrasound, a mammogram and the radiologist did the  ultrasound on the left breast and he left. Then I called him back and told him:  &ldquo;Listen, you forgot the right breast.&rdquo; He came back and did the ultrasound of  the right breast. &ldquo;Everything is ok, it is a cyst.&rdquo; But I don&rsquo;t know, something  inside me was telling me: &ldquo;Go, get a second opinion.&rdquo; Because I left and was  told: &ldquo;There is nothing, those are only cysts.&rdquo; I went back to my family doctor  but he was on vacation. So I went back to the doctor who prescribed the  ultrasound, the referral. He gave me the result and told me: &ldquo;It is nothing, it  is a cyst&rdquo; and all that. Then I said: &ldquo;Listen, I want a second opinion. I want  to see a breast specialist.&rdquo; So, I was sent to another centre.</p></div>
