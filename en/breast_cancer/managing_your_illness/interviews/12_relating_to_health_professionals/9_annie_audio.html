		<p>Except that for me, in the Fall I  had seen a radio oncologist for the first time to plan the treatments after the  surgery. But I can&rsquo;t say that it went very well, but it was ok. But when I saw  her again after the surgery, I was really discouraged after seeing her. She  told me that it could go at least to the second degree, that it was certain. It  was automatic… that I would have a hard time to eat, and she was, everything to  discourage me.  I was already scared of  the radiotherapy! Frankly, I found that it was not reassuring me at all. During  few days I seriously thought of not even having radiotherapy because with the  type of cancer that I have I was telling myself &ldquo;Is it worthwhile to suffer so  much for the time I have left to live?&rdquo; I then asked to change doctor. I called  the hospital and asked to change doctor. I said that it was not working for me  with that person, that if I was really to burn to the second degree I needed  someone with empathy since that person didn&rsquo;t have any. That&rsquo;s it. I thought I  would have to fight with them, feel some resistance because I was asking to  change doctor, but no, they immediately did it. And after, with the second  doctor, it went very well. He was super nice. So it was the second one that  talked to me about the hotel. And he told me &ldquo;No, if I see that the burning is  too severe we will do, we will work at controlling it so that you burn as  little as possible. Yes, you will burn, a little bit like a sunburn. It was  much less… listening to him it was not as bad as what the other told me… What  the second one told me is what happened.</p></div>
