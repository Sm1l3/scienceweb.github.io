<h1><strong>Managing within the health care system</strong></h1>

<p>We asked the women we interviewed about their experiences within the health care system and many described feeling satisfied with the system or at least parts of it. They highlighted things they appreciated such as good organization of care, good collaboration amongst institutions, seamless transition from private to regular health care, and their gratefulness to receive care for free.  Yet most women also encountered difficulties and problems within the health care system. In the following we present women's experiences with managing their care, navigating the health system, problems they encountered, and their advice on improvement.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Managing their care</h2>
<p>Managing their care and navigating the system was something most women had to learn. Women said things like: it's making your own way and being your own advocate, do not back off, don't be afraid, it is a lot of work or difficult and I just followed my instincts or guts. Shelley found that it is hard to manage your own care when you do not have all the information.</p>

<div class="purpleBox">
	<a style="float:left;"><img src="../profile/100x100/33_Ginette.jpg" /></a>
  <div class="purpleBoxContainer">
		<div class="purpleBoxContent">Having experienced several errors, Ginette is more defensive and feels nobody should be left alone in the emergency department.</div>
		<a href="javascript:shadowPopup('',922,630, 'interviews/11_managing_within_the_health_system/1_ginette.html'); void(0);"><span style="font-size:14px"> »</span> Watch</a>
	</div>
	<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>

<p>Women describe the things they do to improve the management of their care, such as writing information down and organizing it in folders; some women selected their own doctors and Ginette thinks you should always have someone with you. Several women changed doctors or asked for a second opinion (see also the page <a href="relating_health_professionals.html">'relating to health professionals'</a>).</p>

    <div class="purpleBoxContainer">

      <a href="javascript:shadowPopup('',922,630, 'interviews/11_managing_within_the_health_system/3_ginette.html'); void(0);"><span style="font-size:14px"> »</span> Watch</a></div>
    <div class="clear"></div>
  </div>
 <div class="clear"></div>
 
<p>Some women also mentioned their use or desire to use marijuana, either for pain control or to improve the taste sensation. They felt that this treatment should be available more readily for patients, and although some clinicians are supportive, the systems for prescribing and delivery have not been established everywhere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Navigating the system</h2>
<p>In all, navigating the health care system was not easy for most, particularly when the women had to do so many things in such a short time. They described how things could be made easier, such as being able to speak to a navigation nurse or educating patients about their illness to manage their care. Women had different opinions about taking responsibility for managing their illness. Kathryn stated  "this disease is my disease it's not just the doctors' disease and I'm going to do it my way", where  Christine on the other hand  said "I'm so far removed from anatomy classes and chemistry classes and biology class I've no idea so you're the professionals you need to figure out what is going on". </p>

<div class="purpleBox"> <a style="float:left;"><img src="../profile/100x100/10_Patricia.jpg" width="100" height="100" /></a>
    <div class="purpleBoxContainer">
      <div class="purpleBoxContent">Patricia feels that patients should be sharing responsibility with their providers for their care and decision-making. </div>

    <div class="clear"></div>

    <div class="purpleBoxContainer">
      <div class="purpleBoxContent"> Laurie thinks that people can be better informed about their own illness. </div>
      <a href="javascript:shadowPopup('',922,630, 'interviews/11_managing_within_the_health_system/5_laurie.html'); void(0);"><span style="font-size:14px"> »</span> Watch</a></div>
    <div class="clear"></div>
  </div>
 <div class="clear"></div>
 
<p>Even though everyone had different approaches and comfort levels in dealing with their disease, coping with the 'system' was sometimes problematic. As Laurie said "my medical records are spewed all over those 9 locations and no one has all of it. I'm the only one who knows the whole story which is not good, super not good".  Other women also noted that either they or their GP were the only ones that had the full picture. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Continuity of care</h2>
<p>When Laurie heard she had breast cancer her first worry was about having to deal with the medical establishment. Like Laurie, several other women spoke about having to undergo different kind of treatments in different places. Jeanette, for example, was moved from one location to another just after the wire for the biopsy was put into place and had to hold a cup on her breast to protect the wire. Ginette spoke about the financial and the physical impact when having to go to many different locations. Travel distance to receive care was a problem for several women. Radiation services for Jocelyn were a 2-hour drive away; some women had to stay in another town for treatment, see <a href="../treatment/radiation.html">radiation</a>. </p>
<p>Communication with  healthcare teams as well as between institutions were highlighted as problems  for some. </p>

<div class="purpleBox">
	<a style="float:left;"><img src="../profile/100x100/28_Christine.jpg" /></a>
	<div class="purpleBoxContainer">
		<div class="purpleBoxContent">Having diabetes and breast cancer was a challenge for Christine and she felt that there was little communication amongst the professionals. </div>
		<a href="javascript:shadowPopup('',922,630, 'interviews/11_managing_within_the_health_system/6_christine.html'); void(0);"><span style="font-size:14px"> »</span> Watch</a>
	</div>
	<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>

<p>Shelley felt that there was a good communication with her health professionals but that there was a lack of communication amongst the health professionals. Amanda felt that despite the electronic system she was still the 'go between' to ensure all information was in the right place. And Debbra warns others to make sure that the pharmacy knows which drugs you are taking as they are not always linked with the cancer agency. Julia and Tina declined hormone therapy and were told by their oncologists that they were not able to continue seeing them anymore. Julia is now seen by a naturopath and Tina by her surgeon. Nadia (A) described how she would never call her doctor for a follow-up but wait until the doctor contacts her, her daughter who was present during the interview, emphasized how people with another cultural background may be more hesitant to contact the doctor to follow-up. </p>
<p>Waiting times were  an issue for several women; some spoke about waiting times before appointments  and others about long waits between diagnosis and first treatment &ndash; this time  felt especially long when they had no support system in place yet. Several  women thought this was one of the most important things to improve in the health  system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Private care settings</h2>
<p>Several women underwent treatment in private care settings, a few to speed up the treatment, however some women ended up in private care by accident, e.g. Annie thought the private clinic was covered by her insurance. Despite the additional financial costs, women were happy with the timely care in the private clinics and felt there was good collaboration between the clinic and regular system.</p>

	<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Inappropriate procedures</h2>
<p>Some women experienced inappropriate procedures or interactions with the system, finding this emotionally painful.  Lorna was called to book an appointment for screening after her mastectomy and Amanda highlighted how frustrating it was to have to recount her family history over and over again.</p>

<div class="purpleBox">
	<a style="float:left;"><img src="../profile/100x100/04_Joanne.jpg" /></a>
	<div class="purpleBoxContainer">
		<div class="purpleBoxContent">After her mastectomy Joanne was asked about her breast complaints during screening, Joanne responded with humour. </div>

	</div>
	<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Advice</h2>
<p>Women suggested that health professionals be better supported so they could spend more time with patients. A 'breast cancer pathway' could help patients avoid problems, not falling into the cracks of the system (e.g. better advice regarding exercise and physiotherapy after lymph nodes dissection). Some women spoke about training for staff to adopt a whole person approach and paying better attention to patients' emotional well-being, e.g. providing more Wellness centres. Amanda spoke about the importance of covering egg preservation in her own province. She also emphasized the importance of having separate emergency services for people undergoing chemotherapy as they have a suppressed immune system.</p>
