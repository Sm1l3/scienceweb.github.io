	<p style="line-height:0.7em;"><strong>Her background:</strong> </p>
	<p>May-Lie  (59 years old) has a partner who has two children. She worked as a secretary  but is currently retired.</p>
<div class="clear"></div>
	<p>May-Lie  was diagnosed in 2010. A lump was found in her breast during a medical visit to  her GP who advised her to wait for the results of the mammography. May-Lie  decided to consult with her gynecologist as well and he asked her to follow-up  with more tests at the hospital. Within a week, May-Lie had a biopsy and was  told that the lump was cancerous. May-Lie received different signals at this  time; the gynecologist had told her it was urgent but other professionals tried  to reassure her. She was worried, but hopeful that things move quickly as soon  as she met the surgeon. The waiting period of 19 days to see the surgeon was  really hard for May-Lie; she slept little and was worried. She tried to  reassure herself by telling herself that it couldn’t be too bad if they let her  wait that long. By the time she did meet the surgeon she was extremely nervous  and had a panic attack during the pre-surgical visit. Now she knows that this  was a panic attack, but at the time she did not know what was happening to her.  Her surgeon thought she was being aggressive. On the day of her scheduled  lumpectomy, May-Lie was asked to present herself at the hospital at 7:00 in the  morning. She expected to be operated on right away and by the time she had her operation  at 13:30 she, again, had become very nervous. Unfortunately her margins were  not clear and what May-Lie believed was going to be one surgery for a  lumpectomy became a series of three surgeries in 3 months (another lumpectomy  followed by a mastectomy). These unexpected events had an enormous effect on  May-Lie; she became very anxious and experienced several panic attacks. Before  her third surgery she felt unable to deal with it anymore and she realized  later that she had hardly remembered anything that was said when she met the  surgeon. The experience with the surgeon had been so bad that May-Lie decided  to change hospitals for her chemotherapy, even when this meant that she would  have to travel more. In her new hospital May-Lie had a totally different  experience; she was better informed and was able to interact well with the  health professionals. The fact that the healthcare professionals worked  together as a team made a big difference to May-Lie and she noticed that  everybody was well informed about her illness status. May-Lie appreciated that  she was able to call an oncologist on weekends with questions about the side  effects of the chemotherapy. May-Lie, who is in remission at this point, finds  it hard to accept her scars from the mastectomy. Neither May-Lie nor her  partner are able look at the scars or touch them. The level of intimacy in  their relationship has reduced significantly since the operations. May-Lie  finds great support with her occupational therapist who provides good support  and listens well to her concerns.&nbsp; </p>
