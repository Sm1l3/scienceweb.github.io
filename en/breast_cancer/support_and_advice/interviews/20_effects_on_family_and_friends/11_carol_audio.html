		<p>It’s really not; it’s not a big deal. There was through the hospital, there’s a, can’t remember what it’s called? You could go to a seminar where they teach you how to put on make-up and how to tie scarves, and I did go to it. And it was very helpful to be around other women who were going through the same thing etc., etc., etc. But I find I, I’m fine I could put on eyebrows, so sometimes it depends on where I’m going. In my local community I just go out as I am. I always wear a head scarf I’m not quite ready to go out bald but when I’m going a little bit further out and I don’t really want any questions or funny looks or anything like that, I’ll put eyebrows on. It makes a big difference, it makes a big difference but that’s about it. </p>
        <p>And the community has been very supportive. I go into the grocery store and somebody’s always asking how I am? If I need anything? If I can do anything? Neighbours have helped. People involved with their kids, involved with my kids, they’ve given lifts, they baby-sit, so it’s been good, it’s been a very good experience. I’ve had a lot of help from friends, from family and from just the community at large, it’s been good.</p>
        <p>Again, it’s hard. You just don’t realize it colours all of your life. I’ve actually been gaining weight which I understand is actually pretty common in breast cancer, but I’m like: I’m sick, I’m supposed to lose weight. You know people are saying “Oh you look great Carol.” I’m like “Yeah but I don’t feel great sometimes.” So it’s hard. It’s hard sometimes because when I really don’t feel well I stay in the house, and then when I feel okay I’m out and you know I have to do the groceries. I have to run errands, I have to do all that sort of thing. People are like well you look fabulous, you look great Carol you know and I’m like okay but I still don’t feel well. </p>
