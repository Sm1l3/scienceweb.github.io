		<p>My daughter and her friend and I, and I was still tired, and we were sitting in the middle of the mall. I was just waiting for them and my daughter was standing there talking to me and she said “Mom, I want to go hit that woman.” There was a woman behind me walking by me and she said “Mom I’m going to go hit that woman, she won’t stop staring at you.” I said ‘Well dear you don’t know, you don’t know what she’s thinking. She might have gone through this herself, she might know exactly how I’m feeling. That may be the reason she’s looking at me because she knows or she knows of somebody who’s been through it. It’s not that she’s judging me and thinking that I shouldn’t be here without no hair it’s… you don’t know why she’s looking at me.” “Oh okay” she said. You don’t know, and it didn’t bother me to be out without it because I’m still me.
