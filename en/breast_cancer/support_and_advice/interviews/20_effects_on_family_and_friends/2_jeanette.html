		<p>It was really hard because my sisters and brothers knew but their children didn’t. So now I have nieces who’ve just turned teenagers and they’re not aware of their family history. I don’t know when their parents will tell them but that’ll be up to them. I went to Christmas dinner with no hair and no wig and I just told them “I just cut it all off because I wanted to.” They were all happy with that. You know they were 10 and 11 at the time but you have to wonder what they do think, but I didn’t care. But it’s still really hard now… because we just referred to when I had short hair.</p>
