		<p>I<strong>nterviewer:</strong> You received a whole set of information?</p>
        <p>Oh you receive everything. The nurses will sit down with you and go through: this is what we’re going to do, this is what you can expect, this is what you will experience, this is what you can do to take care of it. And then, when the test results came back, they sat down with me and went through everything. They say estrogen positive, well this is not good but we can treat it with Tamoxifen; progesterone negative which is good, they told me exactly what everything meant, so I knew what I was dealing with.</p>
      <p>I feel the treatment of breast cancer they have it down to a science. Here we can call the hospital, leave a message for the nurse, she calls back, she knows exactly what you have to do and then you don’t endure it again for the chemo treatments and the radiation. They’re all very, very good here. We’re very lucky to have all of them.</p>
