		<p>I certainly did some searches on the Internet, but also, I’m an old-fashioned kind of girl in the sense of sort of being quite critical and critically thinking about what it is that I’m reading on the Internet. So I did the Canadian Cancer Society and the American Cancer Society and some of the universities in the States who’d had sort of stuff on cancer. But mostly the folks out of the Breast Network, my family physician and the different specialists, although I, if I was to suggest some issues that need to be dealt with is across an interdisciplinary approach to helping folks. Because I in fact, I mean they were very kind whether it was the dieticians or the doctors, but they in fact weren’t… like am I the only one that has Type 1 diabetes and has cancer at the same time? Do you guys not talk to each other around a holistic approach to this?</p>
