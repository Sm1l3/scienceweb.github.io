		<p>I’m a list maker, so for me, my question would be to my friend that had had breast cancer, “What do I need to ask about radiation?”  I Googled top ten things to ask your radiation (technician). I know it’s silly, but I’d go in with a list and I felt like if my list was answered then I felt I had been heard. That worked for me, I had a binder with all the results and we would ask questions if we didn’t understand. I think maybe just having a doctor that confirms your understanding is really helpful. And strangely enough I had a plastic surgeon that was very good at that and very direct, I felt like sometimes if I didn’t ask the question I wouldn’t be given that information and for me, I like to have all the information.</p>
