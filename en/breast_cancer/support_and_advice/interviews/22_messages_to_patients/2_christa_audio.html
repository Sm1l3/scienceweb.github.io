		<p>I was always able to handle it. I think that even sometimes when I’m teaching kids stuff and it’s new stuff they’re just like “I can’t do this I’m never going to get through this.” And it was, I felt the same thing with the cancer. I just I can’t do this, there’s no way and your body actually really can. I think that if they just know that, just give things a little bit of time. Sometimes the doctors could give a little bit less time in between when they tell you stuff. But patient giving themselves more time and the doctors maybe get stuff to them sooner and then it makes the process easier if that’s at all possible.
