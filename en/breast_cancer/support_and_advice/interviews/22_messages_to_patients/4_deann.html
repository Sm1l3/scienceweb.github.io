		<p>I don’t know I think you’ve just got to have a positive attitude. I think that’s the key, try to be as optimistic as you can. Reach out to your friends and don’t try to keep it all contained. I just felt that for me being positive about the whole thing was… I was better off than going around being negative. I mean, everyone deals with it in their own way. Some people don’t want to talk about it and I didn’t mind talking about it. And like I said, I just had a colleague that works with me, she just had her mastectomy 2 weeks ago and she called me and I said you know if you need any questions answered, I didn’t mind talking about it. So I think being positive is much better than being negative, there’s no doubt.</p>
