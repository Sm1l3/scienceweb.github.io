		<p>First thing yeah is check yourself regularly. Do not trust the health system because you have to be proactive for yourself. It’s very important and second of all just regular mammograms. Go for it, don’t delay on it, it’s important and your diet and your exercise and your consistency. And basically, you can learn a lot on the Internet and if you have any questions call them but use the good sites, the good sites which are available. And your shakes, I personally think I would give everybody advice. What I ate and what gave me strength is my juice every morning and that’s what really helped me and your vegetables and there’s a lot on the Internet what is good for you and what is not good for you.</p>
