		<p>I think just to be there, if the person wants to talk fine, if they don’t want to talk that’s fine. Try to keep it light, don’t dwell on things that have. That’s what I appreciated, when they come in and they talk about other things. But it was really funny because say I’m sitting here and I’ve got this, I had bandages back then and I’m sitting here and you’d see them looking... I don’t know, just keep it light, keep it just friendly and light but if the person wants to talk about it then just listen because that means there’s probably something they need to get off their chest… literally.
