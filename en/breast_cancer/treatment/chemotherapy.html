<h1><strong>Chemotherapy</strong></h1>

<p>Chemotherapy is a  drug treatment that targets the cancer but it does have important side effects.  It is injected into a vein over multiple sessions, and usually given after  surgery for breast cancer. The goal is to destroy any remaining cancer cells at  the tumour location, as well as cells that may  have spread to other parts of the body. Chemotherapy helps reduce the risk of recurrence. For very large breast  cancer tumours, chemotherapy may be given before surgery. The goal of  chemotherapy before surgery is to shrink the tumour so that it is easier to  operate on. This is known as &ldquo;neoadjuvant chemotherapy&rdquo;. Not all women we interviewed received  chemotherapy; some women, for example, underwent a lumpectomy and radiation therapy.  In this page we present the experiences of women who told us about their  chemotherapy treatment.</p>

<p>Women described different kind of chemotherapy treatments depending on their personal circumstances. Some received chemotherapy weekly and others once every two or three weeks. Some women also received different combinations of chemotherapy during their treatment. Isla said: "It's very scary and daunting at the beginning of the first treatment, I feel for any woman walking in there because nobody gets good at chemo." Malika said: "Chemotherapy is a poison that is healing us."  Most women had undergone chemotherapy after surgery but a few had it before surgery.</p>

<h2>Considering chemo</h2>
<p>Tina and Laurie considered chemotherapy but decided  against it. Tina felt she would not be able to deal with it physically. </p>

 <p>Christa's family did not feel that chemotherapy was a good idea for her because she was pregnant, but she did decide to undergo the treatment to increase her survival chances given that it was OK to undergo chemotherapy in the second trimester of her pregnancy. Unfortunately, Shelley experienced complications from her surgery which included reconstruction so her chemotherapy was delayed for 10 weeks. </p>
 
   <p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Treatment sessions</h2>
<p>For some women chemotherapy was less difficult than they expected, such as for Melissa and Sirkka, who had a few sores in their mouths but not a lot of nausea. Medication for nausea helped several women. </p>

  <p>Many women described the cycle of feeling sick for one week after chemo, starting to feel better the second week and feeling okay the third just before the next therapy. Nalie said "It's a psychological thing as well because it's almost like you're climbing this mountain - as soon as you reach a peak someone pushes you back down and you have to start all over again that's what chemotherapy felt like."</p>
    
    <p>For others, chemo was more difficult. Joanne, for example, had really bad 1st and 6th sessions and felt sicker than ever experienced before. Samantha on the other hand experienced a cumulative effect and the final treatments were the most difficult. Donna felt much sicker than she expected and to her surprise it was possible to reduce her dose after consulting her oncologist. Debbra decided to change oncologists after several disagreements about treatment decisions. Her side-effects were much better regulated with her second oncologist.

<p>Women adopted several strategies to reduce the side-effects, such as using ice on certain body parts to prevent mouth sores or discolored nails. Amanda took EPSOM salt baths and Joanne found a great medication at the pharmacy to help with mouth dryness. Shelley found that it helped to roll a golf ball in your hand to reduce the tingling in your fingers.</p>    
    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <h2>White blood cells </h2>   
    <p>Some women had reduced white blood cells because of chemotherapy and had to be treated for this. Christine, for example, was admitted to the hospital as her blood count went down to zero; she was advised to take Neulasta to help her white blood cell count recover. May-Lie had to have Neulasta injections and described the intense pain this caused; she took codeine for the pain. </p>

 <h2>Side-effects</h2>
 <p>Women mentioned the more common side effects of chemotherapy: hair loss, fatigue, weight changes, loss of taste and appetite changes, aching bones, nausea, tingling toes or fingers (neuropathy), black nails or loss of nails, painful or restless legs, loss of concentration, mouth and vaginal sores, and bad moods or aggressive feelings. Some women also experienced other side-effects that were less common, such as Malika's burning sensation in her body and her tears. May-Lie had a strong urge to be active and hospital staff called her a 'walkaholic'. Ginette had such mouth pain that she had difficulty eating. There was considerable variation in the type and intensity of side effects that women described, and in their reactions to them. </p>
 
<div class="purpleBox">

<p>Nadia (B) mentions in the clip that nails can turn black, it happens in some cases that women have discolored nails. Undergoing chemotherapy treatments can also cause infertility or an early onset of menopause. Young women had to therefore decide, before chemotherapy started, if they wished to undergo cryo preservation (egg freezing) to increase their chances of being able to get pregnant after the treatment. You can read more about this in <a href="../body_and_life/preserving_fertility.html">preserving fertility</a>.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <h2>Hair loss</h2>
 <p>A common side-effect of chemotherapy is the loss of hair. Women described losing their hair in different ways and times. For some, this started a 10 days after their first treatment and for others it started around the 3rd week. Some women gradually lost their hair and others described the process as 'fast and furious'. Iceni for example remembered a clump of hair blowing away in the wind during a storm. Debbra's hair only thinned following her first treatment. Another thing sometimes noted was the remarkable loss of all body hair, including the hair on arms and legs, eyebrows and eyelashes, pubic hair but also the hair in their nose. </p>
 <p>Women made very personal choices around anticipating hair  loss. Some women shaved their hair before it started to fall out and others  tried to keep their hair for as long as possible.&nbsp; Julie decided to try many different haircuts  before taking it all off; Melissa donated her hair to an organization that made  wigs for children with cancer; and Christine ended up participating in a  fashion show just after her head was shaved which was, in her words, &lsquo;a real  gift&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Joanne has always loved bald heads and was excited when her hair started falling out, but it surprised her that her father, who normally doesn't pay attention to looks, asked her about getting a wig. For most women though it was hard to lose their hair, feeling that they looked different or unhealthy, and some described it as catastrophic, awful, horrifying, or the most difficult thing. They talked about finding it difficult to see themselves in a mirror. Christa felt defeated and sensed a loss of control. Malika and Debrra's sons found it hard to see their mother without hair. </p>

<div class="clear"></div>

<p>Wigs were worn by some but not all women liked them. Amanda felt she was not herself, while others felt it was hot or uncomfortable. Isla wore the wig when going out to avoid having to share her story to people she knew less well. </p>

<div class="purpleBox">
	<a style="float:left;"><img src="../profile/100x100/08_Jeanette.jpg" /></a>
	<div class="purpleBoxContainer">
		<div class="purpleBoxContent">Being bald out in public provoked some supportive reactions from customers, but it was harder within Jeanette's family – some cousins didn't know she was ill. </div>

<div class="clear"></div>

<p>Women wore hats, bandanas, fancy caps and scarves on their heads. Being bald was, for some women, an opportunity to change hair color with a wig or style their re-growth in different ways. Laurie has enjoyed becoming a blond and has worn her hair short since chemotherapy. Some changes were unexpected: some grew back hair that was more coarse or curly, or thinner for some. Isla's hair came back grey and Christine expected grey but it was beautiful, black and curly. Christine and Christa were happy to have less body hair after the re-growth. Donna joked about the first hair that grew back having to be her chin hair.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Weight changes</h2>
<p>Donna says "I'm one of the few people that lost weight on chemotherapy it's the worst, worst diet in the world." Most women that we spoke with gained weight during treatment, but felt that there were several contributors, such as steroids, reduced activity when feeling unwell, changed appetite, and early onset of menopause.  This was a sensitive issue for some women who felt uneasy with their weight gain. Women also described difficulties eating which led to changed eating habits – eating smaller, more frequent amounts, and eating before treatment. Shelley loved eating more smoothies. Please visit <a href="../body_and_life/diet_changes_exercise.html" >diet and exercise</a> to read more about this. Julie felt like she was in another body. Others were happy to have gained weight as expected. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Chemo brain</h2>
<p>Less common as a side effect but noticed by some was 'chemo brain'. Chemo brain is a common term used by cancer survivors to describe thinking and memory problems that can occur after cancer treatment. Chemo brain can also be called chemo fog, chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment or cognitive dysfunction. Melissa and Christine described chemo brain as losing their words, an inability to say certain words, or just a 'duh' moment. For Melissa, the words would suddenly pop up later which has affected her confidence a little. Iceni initially thought she had Alzheimer's as she would constantly forget things. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Coping</h2>
<p>Different things helped women to cope with chemotherapy and its consequences, but having company and staying as active as possible was a common theme. Having company during the treatment was important for Shelley and helped her keep calm. Sirkka loved going out in the fresh air even when she was feeling really sick and worked on getting her 'mind over matter'. Carol's children helped her to keep going. Christa tried to reduce the exposure to her unborn baby and belly by uncovering it and tried to keep her belly cold. Shelley describes a loss of her fine motor coordination and did things like playing with playdough to get that back to normal again. Melissa thinks she might have pushed herself a bit too hard in continuing her normal routine; likewise, Jeanette's nurse told her not to push so hard after she told her proudly that she did a 6 km hike. Please visit <a href="../body_and_life/impact_work_finance.html">impact on work and finances</a> to read more about how women combined work and chemotherapy. Keeping a sense of humour was also important to many women we spoke to, you can read more about this in <a href="../emotional_health/coping_strategies.html">coping</a> and <a href="../emotional_health/positive_effects_self.html">positive effects on self</a>.</p>
