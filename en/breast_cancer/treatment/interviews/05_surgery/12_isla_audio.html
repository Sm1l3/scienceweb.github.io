		<p>The surgery’s a day surgery,  even though they, in my case they took quite a bit of tissue, but it was done  in one day. I was able to go home. I went out for lunch with my sister the next  day although I don’t think you should do that. I think that was a bad decision  because I didn’t feel well after that. It was fine if we  look at all the research, the radical mastectomy approach doesn’t have better  outcomes, being able to keep your breast is kind of a nice, nice thing especially  if your surgeon’s really good in terms of not mutilating you I guess, for lack  of a better word. It’s fairly convincing evidence that the partial or partial’s  just another term for lumpectomy, one does not imply more tissue than the  other, it’s just they’re synonymous. So those approaches that are breast  conserving, let’s say, have very good outcomes. There’s really no need for  excess surgery, although it’s kind of clouded now, with all the Angelina Jolie  and stuff, where she’s clearly in a different category with having a BRCA1  gene*(Breast cancer 1 gene). So, I can see why she did what she did, but I  think a lot of women have jumped to surgery thinking it’s, more radical  surgeries, thinking that they’re a better option, when they’re not, when often  times it’s not the case. Because you feel at the time, I understand the  feeling, just take everything away so that this won’t come back, but that’s not  exactly how it works. <br />
</p>
		<p>There was a, well, the decision was to get the tumour  out right away and then see later if there was going to be more surgeries. But at that point if you have clean margins  and the surgery was successful and you can manage how it looks afterwards then  to go on with more surgery, you really have to weigh that out, right. Surgery  and reconstruction, the reconstructive surgeries, from my understanding, from  people who have had them, they’re very… it’s quite invasive. It has to be  weighed pretty carefully. </p>
        <p>Oh, if there’s a recurrence, I think I’ll just sort of  listen to multiple opinions about it but I think (…) I think the one advantage to the double mastectomy approach, is kind  of eliminating mammograms and that kind of thing in the future. But you still  need to be followed up because you can still get a recurrence on a scar.  You can, breast cancer’s sneaky, and that’s the theme I’m coming back to.  You’re never sure fire approach, right. If there’s a recurrence, I would take  that decision at the time given the full knowledge of the situation.</p>
        <p><strong>Interviewer: </strong>How do you feel about the results of the partial  mastectomy?<strong></strong></p>
        <p>Pretty good, really good. A  good surgeon makes a big difference I think. I would tell people to really  scout out their surgeon before even a breast conserving surgery because the  placement of the scar can be camouflaged and it’s a good surgeon can do some  remarkable things and it’s quite amazing.</p>
        <p>*BRCA1 gene: Mutated gene  that can increase the carriers chances of having breast cancer.</p>
