		<p>No they just took the  whole breast off. I said &ldquo;Forget it&rdquo;, this, I should have done it in 2003. All  those four surgeries, I should have listened, and I should have said &ldquo;Take the  whole thing off&rdquo; but again, I was vain at that time. I didn&rsquo;t want to have a  mastectomy, I really didn&rsquo;t and I was adamant that I didn&rsquo;t so that&rsquo;s it. But I  really do believe that if I had of had a mammogram, an ultrasound and maybe  radiation on my breast, I wouldn&rsquo;t have had to have a mastectomy but it&rsquo;s in  the cards, it is what it is. I got very upset with myself, I made a very big  deal about a mastectomy, it really bothered me and because I blamed the doctor,  and I was pissed off that I listened to the doctor, a friend of mine I  remember, I went to the support group once, she told me she had done her scan  and her cancer was in her head. I said to myself &ldquo;How could you complain about  losing a breast when my friend&rsquo;s worried about losing her life.&rdquo; I actually  wrote my doctor a letter and I apologized and I said I made a big deal, I said  it&rsquo;s only a breast. That&rsquo;s why the doctors treat you, to them breasts are  nothing, you can lose a breast you&rsquo;re not going to lose a life, and it&rsquo;s true  the least of your problems are your boobs, and you realize that.</p>
