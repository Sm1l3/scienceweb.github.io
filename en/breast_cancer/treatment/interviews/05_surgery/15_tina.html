		<p>Back before the  surgery I talked a lot with my surgeon and I decided at that time, that I was  going to have both breasts removed. She said &ldquo;Well why?&rdquo; And I said &ldquo;I just  have a sense I want the other one off too because I don&rsquo;t want to go through  all this again.&rdquo; That was fine, so after the surgery, and after the information  came back from the where they sent it away to have it be tested, they found out  that I also had breast cancer in the left breast which they didn&rsquo;t know  anything about because it didn&rsquo;t show up.</p>
        <p>But it was a slow  growing cancer and it was totally different than the one in the right breast. </p>
        <p>It&rsquo;s your body, it&rsquo;s  your decision when it comes right down to it, that&rsquo;s, I was very, very strong  in that and it was the same with the double mastectomy. &ldquo;Are you sure you want  to do this? Do you want to have the breast removed there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with  the other breast.&rdquo; And I said &ldquo;Yes I&rsquo;ve made that decision and I want them both  off.&rdquo; Now I&rsquo;m glad I did because nobody knew about the second cancer that was  in the other breast.</p>
