		<p>I had a TRAM flap*(Transverse  Rectus Abdominis Muscle Flap) and what they did, I&rsquo;m not sure if you know what that is,  that&rsquo;s when they removed your (a muscle from your) stomach and they put it into your breast  and Dr. (name) did that and he was excellent. Before that I saw Dr. (name), I  saw another Dr. I was very disappointed with him because when he had checked  looked at me he told me that I was getting older and saggier and my breasts  were drooping and I&rsquo;d probably get cancer in my other breast, so I may as well have a double mastectomy. I told him I wasn&rsquo;t that vain and I left. I asked to  see another doctor and then I went to Dr. (name). Dr. (name) was absolutely  wonderful, he came to see me every day in the hospital and a couple times a  day. He was very attentive, very good and I was quite happy to have him. One of  the nurses asked me why I would go through all that at once and I told her that  I liked to flash the girls at work and I needed a set. I don&rsquo;t know if she  thought that was funny or not but we that&rsquo;s just me. </p>
        <p>The sad thing is that  I know a lot of women, younger women who have had a double mastectomy and when  I&rsquo;ve asked them they have said &ldquo;Oh! I don&rsquo;t want to get cancer in my other  breast.&rdquo; I think that was put there by a doctor and I don&rsquo;t think that they should  be fear mongering and it&rsquo;s too bad that they do. I understand they&rsquo;re doing, as  far, as I&rsquo;m concerned, they&rsquo;re doing it because they get paid for two  mastectomies, not one. Or it&rsquo;s, they&rsquo;re on the table, they just want to do it  so that then this person won&rsquo;t be back again to have the other one done and  it&rsquo;s too bad. It&rsquo;s too bad that a lot of women are waiting for mastectomies and  they haven&rsquo;t been able to have them yet.</p>
* TRAM flap: A section of the lower belly containing blood vessels,  skin, fat and muscle is cut and used for breast reconstruction. </div>
