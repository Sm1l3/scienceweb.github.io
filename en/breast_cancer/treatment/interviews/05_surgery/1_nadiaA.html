		<p>I’m so scared, whenever I hear about surgery, I’m scared and also having  the breast removed. But I think to myself now the best thing for me is to get  it removed because I’m very afraid for it to spread into my body.</p>
        <p><strong>Interviewer: </strong>Is the fact that your body is changing, is  that affecting you a lot? That the breast will be taken off?</p>
        <p>It affects me a little bit but now that I’m getting to realize well  it’s, no I don’t need to have that there. It’s best to take it off and get rid  of it and I’ll continue living a normal life with maybe one breast. I hope the  other breast doesn’t get it but no, no it’s not bothering me, I just want to  get it off, get it over with and done.</p>
        <p>But now, I feel yes it’s  positive. I should take it off and get it over with and done as I said before;  and get it over with and done that’s the positive side I have really. Just do  it, get it, it doesn’t matter what happens get it over with and done. It’s  there, it has to get out, I just don’t want to keep it and die, if I have  another 10 or 15 years again. Let me get this thing out that’s my positive  thing. Sometimes now, I don’t worry about it. I say look, it has to be out,  just leave it. When the time comes whatever happens. This is my thing now.</p>
