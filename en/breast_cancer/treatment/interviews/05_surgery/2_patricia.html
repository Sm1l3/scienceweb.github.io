		<p>The other thing he said to me which is really, I think important for  women to understand is, he said &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think of this as a lumpectomy. Don&rsquo;t  call it a lumpectomy. People will call it that, it&rsquo;s not. In our terms this is  a partial mastectomy because what will happen to your breast surgically and  what you will have left is not going to look like the other one or like it did  before, you need to be prepared for that.&rdquo; He was quite right. It didn&rsquo;t, but  it&rsquo;s a day surgery, you come home. I think my friends were more, probably,  worried about me than I was but there&rsquo;s always that worry in the back of your  mind. Now I have to wait 5 business days for the report to come in. Well when  it came in it was the lymph nodes were clear and the margins were clear as far  as they could tell. So that was good news. </p>
