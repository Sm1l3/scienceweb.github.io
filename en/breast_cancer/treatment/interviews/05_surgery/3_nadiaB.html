		<p>They scheduled my  surgery, I think it was August 21st, I remember that really well  and it was a very scary feeling. I didn&rsquo;t know what was in there, but I was  very fortunate when the surgeon came out, (he) told my husband that I&rsquo;m going  to be fine, that it hadn&rsquo;t spread anywhere. It was only 1 cm. It hadn&rsquo;t gone  into my margins and it hadn&rsquo;t gone into my lymph nodes. They had only removed  one lymph node. Then she said it will be the usual radiation and chemo. At that  time she didn&rsquo;t tell me anything but then she scheduled an appointment for me  to go in and that&rsquo;s when she told me that I had HER2*(Human Epidermal Growth  Factor Receptor-2). She said &ldquo;That it&rsquo;s a little risky.&rdquo; She said that &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll  have to do chemo&rdquo; because I thought I&rsquo;d get away with just radiation. So with HER2  I had to do chemo and radiation and I had to do Herceptin for about, I think it  was 18 injections, which takes me right into October of this year.</p>
		<p><em>*HER2: A gene present in cells that, in some breast  cancer cases has a mutation. This mutation causes the HER2 gene to be  overproduced in breast cells, causing  cells to be more aggressive. However treatments that target HER2 are very  effective.</em></p>
