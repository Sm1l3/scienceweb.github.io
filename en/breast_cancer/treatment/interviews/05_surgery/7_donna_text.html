		<p>The first time I had surgery to remove the lump in my breast they also did a sentinel node removal. I am sure you are aware that you have to go to nuclear medicine and have a wire inserted and isotopes injected so that they can identify the sentinel node and remove it. My nodes came back clear; which was a relief. I had to have a second surgery however, to get clear margins. They had not taken enough tissue out the first time.  </p>
