		<p>Immediate reconstruction… The goal for me, I told myself: &ldquo;I must save  my own skin, my life. The esthetics, we&rsquo;ll think about it later. But right now,  it is my treatments, it is saving my own skin…&rdquo;&nbsp;I am trying to survive  this and will see after.<br />
		  </p>
		<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> It is a question of priority?<br />
		  </p>
		<p>It&rsquo;s me… For me, I am pragmatic… It is a question of priority. The  esthetics will come after. Frankly, I didn&rsquo;t know how I was going to react. I  didn&rsquo;t know. And I don&rsquo;t know because I am telling myself that some people are  living without arms, legs, without… And the breast, I can… we can live without…  We can live without it. I was more scared of the reconstruction because I  didn&rsquo;t know if I was going to have radiotherapy, knowing that I had something  inside me… I had many questions because… But even the reconstruction it is still  two surgeries. Well it was… Even if it was immediate but I had to be operated a  second time. Am I ready to undergo this and go every week, go to inflate the expander  that they were going to install? What… I didn&rsquo;t have enough strength for all  this. So, I told myself, as well… I must first save my life and then we will  think about the esthetics later and knowing that I would have to undergo  another surgery; because I must have the ovaries and the fallopian tubes removed  because I am a carrier of the Hubert gene.</p>
