		<p>No. In my case, in the case of inflammatory cancer, they tell us to wait  at least one or two years after the radiotherapy. And in the case of  inflammatory cancer, they must remove as much skin as possible because in this  case, the skin is affected, which is not necessarily the case of other forms of  breast cancer.</p>
        <p>Interviewer: Do you want to have a reconstruction after one or two years  or you still don’t know?</p>
        <p>But right now, I don’t want to have the reconstruction. I found the  surgery so difficult and I was told that reconstruction is an even bigger  operation. So right now, I don’t have the intention to have it. However, what would,  what I liked, and this was confirmed by my surgeon, if let’s say next year or  in two years I am not ready, but in five years I change my mind, it will never  be too late for me…</p>
