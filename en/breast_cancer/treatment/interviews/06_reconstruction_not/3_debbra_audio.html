		<p>Because that&rsquo;s a huge  thing that I think patients need to understand and have a lot more information  in terms of what&rsquo;s available out there. There are so many products now,  mastectomy products that I didn&rsquo;t know, that I wasn&rsquo;t aware that they were  available.</p>
        <p><strong>Interviewer: </strong>Prosthesis  you mean?</p>
        <p>Prosthetics. There&rsquo;s  a company here in the city that actually does light weight prosthetics and they  breathe a lot better. They could actually take a mold of your breasts before  you have surgery and then they take pictures so you have the same colour.Â  Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re doing one then they&rsquo;ll have  the exact same size for the other side when you actually have your surgery done.  And so the lady that I was walking through the journey with just recently, she  chose to go that way. So I went with her and it&rsquo;s really quite cool. Now she  has the option of having prosthetics made to match her other breast if she  chooses not to remove her other breast so it&rsquo;ll be the same size. They can do  the same colour and they have incredible ability to do these techniques. <br />
          </p>
        <p>They also do the areola  and the nipple area. If you do reconstruction you can just have that made and  put on so that if you&rsquo;re wearing a T-shirt or something like that, you can have  that. So that&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s a lot of options now where it wasn&rsquo;t available before.  And I think it&rsquo;s a very personal decision in terms of &ldquo;Can you wake up in the  morning and see those scars and being flat?&rdquo; I was incredibly chesty and I had  a very big bust when I was diagnosed and I, me personally, the idea of being flat  was just foreign to me. So I, that&rsquo;s again one of the reasons why I chose  reconstruction.</p>
