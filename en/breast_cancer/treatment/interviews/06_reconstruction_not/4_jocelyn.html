		<p>When I first did  reconstruction, I did…Okay! This is a real boob, this one has a fake one and  I&rsquo;m wearing a little paddy here (pointing at her chest). When you get a  mastectomy, there&rsquo;s nothing there. It&rsquo;s just like a weird warped looking  scar.  It had a weird little cleave in it  and it was just completely flat. And then, they put a tissue expander inside.  They put this hard balloon in and every week I go to the surgeon and they go &ldquo;Whoosh&rdquo;  and it fills up. It&rsquo;s high, I could touch it with my chin because then when  they put the implant in, it&rsquo;ll come down a bit. That was so painful. I&rsquo;ll never,  I would never get a tissue expander it hurts. Maybe some people are different  but I guess the area was just damaged already. It was so screwed up from the  radiation and so screwed up from the surgeries that it hurt a lot. Then I  finally had the implant put in and because I had a weird warpy scar, which  happens sometimes, it wasn&rsquo;t boob shaped. It was like  (indicating the shape with her hand). So 4  weeks ago he, my surgeon, who&rsquo;s actually a really good surgeon, it&rsquo;s really  precise, he cut out the scar… looks like an eye like this. And he cut it out  and he cut a piece of muscle and skin from my back. He brought it out front and  he sewed it up. So there&rsquo;s no weird scar there anymore. He was concerned about  scars, I don&rsquo;t care about scars, I care about shape but I still have an indent  here and he said &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t ignoring your weird indent, there&rsquo;s probably…we have  to do some fat grafting.&quot; You can&rsquo;t make a breast out of nothing. They  can do really amazing things. Part of the reason that breast implants look the  way they do is because they&rsquo;re sitting behind a real breast. There is no breast  there, it&rsquo;s like putting a boob on your back or your knee and trying to make it  look like the other one. </p>
