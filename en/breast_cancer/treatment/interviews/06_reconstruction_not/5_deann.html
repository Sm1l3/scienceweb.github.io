		<p>I  ended up with fat necrosis, probably a  week to 10 days post-op(eration) and I know when I had my surgery… If you&rsquo;re  not familiar with a DIEP flap* (Deep Inferior Epigastric  Perforator Artery Flap), it&rsquo;s a free flap. They use the tissue and  blood vessels from your abdomen and it&rsquo;s total a detachment but, my blood  vessels in my abdomen were just kind of medium size, obviously the bigger the  better, but mine weren&rsquo;t. There was one  area that the blood supply never, wasn&rsquo;t really great to that area. When I had  my reconstructive surgery, I had to end up having to have leech therapy for a  week while I was in hospital to try to improve the blood supply. I  didn&rsquo;t have to go back to the OR (Operating Room) or anything but that area  was…And then because of that, I ended up with a not really good contour. I&rsquo;ve got some concave area there, so just  like I said, I had surgery in February and now the surgeon told me, the plastic  surgeon, he said &ldquo;You may end up having to have more surgery.&rdquo; I probably will end  up having more surgery sometime in the fall.</p>
	  <p>* DIEP Flap: A section of the lower belly containing blood  vessels, skin and fat is cut and used for breast reconstruction. </p>
<p><strong>Interview:</strong> To try  and improve the outlooks?</p>
<p>Yeah!  Because basically like what it is, it&rsquo;s  like a liposuction. They just remove the fat and then they just transfer it. I  was only off work for a couple of weeks with it. So it was not a big thing.  You&rsquo;re in and out the same day.</p>
