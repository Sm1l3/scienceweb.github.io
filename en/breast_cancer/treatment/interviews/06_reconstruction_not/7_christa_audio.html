		<p>I’ve  had them done a few times. The lady that does it is just awesome. She does it…  because I didn’t have another one to look at, she looked at the inside of my lip,  at the pigment there and what it looked like, to see what colour your… because  apparently your areola is generally about the same colour as the inside of your  lip, I guess. She went quite light at first and they almost went to skin colour.  So the last time I went, she ended up doing it like really, really, really dark.  It’s been 2 years now and they’re… I’m going to have to get them done again.  But they look quite real, she does it with different colours and spots. For  some people that didn’t even have the nipple made, she can tattoo on shading so  that it looks like there’s the nipple there.</p>
