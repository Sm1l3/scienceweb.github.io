		<p>He sent me to another  doctor. Most of them are plastic surgeons and because any time you have cancer,  it&rsquo;s all done here under Medicare, so it&rsquo;s free. You can choose any plastic  surgeon you want. So I went to see the doctor he recommended and he looked at  me. He looked at my breast and I don&rsquo;t even think he really touched it. I just  think he looked and he found out it was… I had metastatic disease and he said  &ldquo;The same thing&rsquo;s going to happen if you put it in again. I recommend that you  do nothing just take it out and leave it.&rdquo; I remember that&rsquo;s not what I wanted  to hear. If you&rsquo;re vain at all, and I was vain, I said &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to walk  around with a prosthesis that&rsquo;s moving and I have to worry about it all the  time.&rdquo; Because I knew, a lot of my friends had not done reconstructive surgery.  So he gave me no options. Really, he just said &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do anything.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s not  what I wanted to hear. I went and I started my own research and I found a few  doctors. I interviewed them and I asked them questions. I can&rsquo;t mention names  so the first doctor, I said I want my new breast to look like my old breast. I  want it to look as natural as possible. &quot;We can&rsquo;t do that.&quot; I went on  to the next doctor, the next doctor looked at me and he said &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t wear a  T-shirt.&rdquo; I said &ldquo;You&rsquo;re correct, I can&rsquo;t wear a T-shirt, I have one boob in my  ear and one boob in my waist, it looks very odd. But, it&rsquo;s nice that you  noticed that I can&rsquo;t wear a T-shirt.&rdquo; I said &ldquo;Can you make my breasts look  natural enough that it doesn&rsquo;t look like it&rsquo;s…up here?&quot; He says &ldquo;Yes, I  can.&rdquo; So I ended up choosing him after I had gone back to the second doctor and  asked him a few more questions, I decided I didn&rsquo;t want him. </p>
        <p> I went back to the third doctor and I said  that I had chosen him. He was one of the most compassionate doctors I&rsquo;ve ever  met. The breast actually does look pretty natural. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s going  to stay that way because you never know with these things. And it was actually  this doctor who said that the majority of women know nothing about it, about  reconstructive surgery because nobody tells them. And am I happy with my  implant? Well, I would prefer to have my breast back but it&rsquo;s there and it&rsquo;s  easier to dress. That&rsquo;s what the whole point for me was, just to have it to  facilitate things.</p>
