		<p>Well I had done a lot  of research because they&rsquo;re, when they tell you &ldquo;You have breast cancer and you  need to have a mastectomy.&rdquo; Well that&rsquo;s it. But then when you decide to have  reconstructive surgery, there&rsquo;s so many. You can have nothing done, or you can  have this done, there&rsquo;s four or five different things you can have done. So, of  course, the decision&rsquo;s all in your hands. I did a lot of research on it before  I decided what I would have done.</p>
      <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> You said &ldquo;You  have to make the decisions yourself&rdquo; so?</p>
      <p>When you decide to  have reconstruction as to what you want to have done. Like I said, you can have  nothing done, you can have a tissue expander and an implant or you can have, like  I had DIEP Flap. You can have a TRAM Flap*(Transverse Rectus  Abdominis Muscle Flap)  , so I went with the DIEP flap*(Deep Inferior Epigastric Perforator Artery Flap) .</p>
      <p>* TRAM Flap: A section of  the lower belly containing blood vessels, skin, fat and muscle is cut and used  for breast reconstruction</p>
      <p>* DIEP Flap: A section of the lower belly containing  blood vessels, skin and fat is cut and used for breast reconstruction. </p>
