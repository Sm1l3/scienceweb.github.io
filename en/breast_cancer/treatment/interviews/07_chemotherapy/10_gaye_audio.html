		<p>I went through chemo, like I said it made my feet numb. After the second treatment I couldn’t walk very well for a while. My feet are  still numb, it’s about 5 years, but my balance is much better. I have to make  sure that I wear flat shoes, but I’m good. I’ve lost some of my memory and I’m  not sure if that’s from the chemo or radiation. I had 25 radiation treatments  and I am fine. I lost my hair. My biggest fear was that my dad was bald and I  was afraid that I would wake up one night and go in the bathroom and think it  was my dad staring back at me, but I didn’t look too bad. My daughter was here  and one day we were sitting at the table, I threw a towel or something over my  shoulder, she said &quot;Oh my God, you look like Ghandi.&quot; And so I got  her to take a picture of me,  I sent it  to my friends by e-mail saying &quot;Ghandi wants to speak&quot; and I told  them a little thing and I put this picture on there. I, you know, I wore a  couple wigs, I became a brunette for a while and that was something different.  My husband wasn’t sure if he liked that, he had said &quot;Don’t wear that when  you’re with me.&quot; We went out one night for supper with friends and the  waitress was a friend of one of my daughters. She was talking to (name husband)  but she never said anything to me, and I thought, well, she didn’t recognize  who you were. And I said who I was and she said &quot;Oh I didn’t recognize  you, I thought (name husband) was with someone else&quot; and my husband said  see I told you. So that was quite funny I thought.</p>
