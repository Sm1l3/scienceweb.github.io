		<p>It was hard because I wouldn’t wear a wig so I had  no hair. I went back to work and I waited on my customers, because I work in  retail, and a lot of the times they didn’t know who I was. But at the same time  I would have women come up to me and say &quot;Oh! What type of cancer did you  have?&quot; And then they would tell me their story which was great because  they had been through it so it was good, it was a happy ending to see them  standing in front of me. I even had a man come in who said his mother, who died  maybe 5 years ago at the age of 87; she had had breast cancer when she was in  her 20s. </p>
		<p> It was really hard because my sisters and brothers  knew but their children didn’t. So now I have nieces who’ve just turned  teenagers and they’re not aware of their family history. I don’t know when  their parents will tell them but that’ll be up to them. I went to Christmas  dinner with no hair and no wig, I just told them I just cut it all off because  I wanted to and they were all happy with that. You know they were 10 &amp; 11 at  the time but you have to wonder what they do think, but I didn’t care. But it’s  still really hard now because we just referred to when I had short hair. </p>
