		<p>Even chemo brain, that was something that you read a little bit about. I  did not anticipate... I thought &quot;Oh, I won’t get chemo brain, I’m always  reading, I’m always doing this.&quot; I couldn’t remember the word vacuum, I  was describing the machine that picked up dirt off the floor. Little things  that you take for granted every day, I couldn’t put together in a phrase...  that was frustrating at times. So again, I’m at physio and I said to my  therapist... she asks how things are going and I said &quot;I think I’m losing  my mind I can’t remember things, things that I’ve done every day I’ve taken for  granted.&quot; Just the fine motor coordination things as well, not just the  verbal. I would look at things going &quot;I don’t know.&quot; When she said  &quot;Oh, you need to talk to so and so or come to this meeting or here’s a  resource&quot; It was like &quot;Oh thank you I’m not losing my mind.&quot;  This is part of this treatment but when you can’t find information on it...  wow. <br />

		<p>It scares you and then you start thinking is cancer  in my brain? Because you’re in a vulnerable place where you have no control. At  work they were very good with my chemo brain and I came back and I said I’m not  back with an A game. The one I had before I left, I’m hoping at best it would  be on my B, C or D game. I’ll let you know. So everybody was great, they knew  hot flashes would hit me hard. At first it was uncomfortable for me and for  them, you know, you’re in a suit, you’re at a table and making decisions and  whoosh! You are beet red and you’re like pour the water on me somebody. It’s  become more of a joke now, everyone’s at ease with it. My brain thoughts, my  speech patterns have come a long way compared to where they were when I started  the back to work. Just again, it’s the routine getting back into the swing of  work life and home life has helped me to recover as well definitely.</p>
