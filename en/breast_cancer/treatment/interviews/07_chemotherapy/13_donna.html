		<p>I was surprised at how much laughter there can be  during this journey. I’ve sort of learned to belly laugh, again like some  things are just so ridiculous that you have to laugh and it’s what helps you  get through it. </p>
        <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> What makes you laugh?<strong></strong></p>
        <p>Well just the absurdity of you’re sitting here and  all of a sudden your thumbnail goes. I just lost it, just before you came in.  It was like &quot;Oh I hope this doesn’t really hurt because I’ll be focused on  that.&quot; So, we were having quite a laugh about that in the hall while you  were setting up. I was in the store one day, I was in the drugstore with my  daughter and because I didn’t have any feeling in my fingers I drop things,  right. So I got my wallet out and it fell to the floor and I bent over to pick  it up and my wig flipped off. And I stood up and just the look on the person’s  face that was standing behind me. They were just in shock, it was so those kind  of things are very, very funny. </p>
      <p><strong>Interviewer: </strong>Well it’s wonderful  that you can laugh.<strong> </strong></p>
        <p>Well what are you going to do, right? So it’s just  realizing that it’s the reality. It’s the very real situations that you get in  and you can cry and feel sorry for yourself if you want and if you do that good  for you. You deserve to be able to do that but you know what? You can also  laugh about it afterwards because some of it is just absurd.  </p>
