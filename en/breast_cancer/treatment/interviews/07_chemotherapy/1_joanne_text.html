		<p>In the beginning... we hear about people on chemotherapy. You think they’re on chemotherapy and they’re hooked up to IV for all this time, like somebody’s doing chemo. But you’re in for one day or two days, the day before you need blood work done and the next day you need to be hooked up for a couple hours or I don’t know, maybe it was the whole day.  I think people believed that your off a week of chemo and then the 2 weeks that you’re not on it.  It’s the week of taking oral drugs and leading up to that 1 day on the IV for me. So I don’t think I knew. Some people when I’d talk to them realized that that’s all it is. It’s just that 1 day a week that you’re over to the hospital hooked up to IV.</p>
