		<p>Initially when I had gone for my follow-up, with  my surgeon, she had mentioned, you know, the fact that I would likely have to do chemotherapy   based on the histology of the sample. My mom had not done chemotherapy  for her first round when she had breast cancer.&nbsp;So it was very...  and she was very healthy at the time and had no concerns about any recurrence.  So it was a very difficult decision&nbsp;for me to decide whether or not to go that route despite all the  recommendations that the physicians were giving to me.<br />
And you know, they kind of give you, they  kind of give you the statistic and you can kind of understand what it means but  there’s  always these caveats that underlie everything. So after speaking with... I did  a lot of research on it, and after speaking with a naturopath, some other  friends and other women through a peer network, I was able&nbsp;to come to the conclusion that probably the  best option for me was to pursue the recommended course of action by the  physicians.&nbsp;So I began chemotherapy in April of last year.</p>
      <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> So and  did you feel you had a clear idea of your treatment plan when you first started  or how did you follow?</p>
        <p>No, I didn’t  because&nbsp;I wasn’t really sure exactly how everything was going to  move forward. At my first oncology appointment it was almost like the decision  was made for me. Like the oncologist came in and was talking with me and  explaining that this is the regime, this is how it’s done and moving forward.&nbsp;She was  happy to answer my questions but when I had a bit of reluctance about talking  about doing chemo, she was kind of like &quot;Oh! Well what are you worried  about?&quot; And it wasn’t a very supportive  approach. I explained to her that&nbsp;I  was worried that I had these other family members who did this and it didn’t work for them.&nbsp;  I was concerned that I was going to be doing this kind of for nothing. I was  going to be putting my body through this crazy toxic environment for months and  then burning my skin for months to end up with a similar result and that was  what I was concerned about. When I explained it to her in that way, she was a  bit more understanding as to where I was coming from. But yeah as physicians  do, they kind of revert back to numbers sometimes, and&nbsp;so she explained to me what the percent  chance of recurrence with chemo was and what the percent chance of recurrence  without chemo was.<br />
          </p>
        <p>So from that appointment I took away that  information and did a bit more research and chatted with a few more  people.&nbsp;I was able to come to the  conclusion on my own. But I’d have to say I wasn’t afraid to, I wasn’t afraid to tell somebody, to tell a physician that  that wasn’t my decision.&nbsp;So  I think that it was really important that I just kept up the fact that it was  my treatment and I just stayed with that approach. Like yes, I’m their  patient, but it’s my treatment and it’s my body. So I just kind  of kept that in my back pocket and they had... I went to the appointment and  they already had me scheduled for my first chemo treatment. They had me  scheduled for all of these different things and I was just... I need some  breathing, I need to breathe for a minute. In the course of that period of time  I was able to do the research that came to, that helped me come to my  conclusion. I just kind of said &quot;  I need some time to think about it this is a bit, it’s coming in a bit fast and I want to, I need to feel  comfortable with my decision because it’s just going to make it harder to endure I think if  I'm not comfortable.&quot; </p>
