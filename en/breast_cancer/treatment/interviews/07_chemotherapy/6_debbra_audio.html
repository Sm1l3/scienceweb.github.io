		<p>My first experience was extremely exhausting  because it was fighting, it was trying to figure out what was going on. I was  very disillusioned with, with how bad the healthcare system was and then I was  lucky, I had a great social worker. The social worker allowed me to put things  in place so that I could switch oncologists.<br />
		  </p>
		<p>So here in the city we have one cancer agency  and so my biggest fear was if I switch oncologists will my care be minimized or  downgraded because now I’m considered a troubled patient or a difficult  patient. And so again, it goes back to these patients who don’t realize, if  they’re not connecting with their oncologist, it’s okay to switch oncologists.  You may not connect with them for numerous ways but if you don’t trust your  oncologist and if you can’t communicate with your oncologist get a different  oncologist. It is so important that you go through this journey supported and  feeling that you're not second guessing every single thing that the oncologist  is doing. So that put a very bad taste in my mouth for the whole system as it  is.</p>
		<p>This  new oncologist was a lot better and we finished, got my, got everything  adjusted in terms of dosage and different things.</p>
