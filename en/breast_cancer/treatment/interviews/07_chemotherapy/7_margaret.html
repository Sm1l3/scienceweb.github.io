	<p>One, yeah, every 3 weeks, and I was very lucky I  think from what other people experience. I certainly did have a few days where  I felt really awful. One of my biggest complaints I think or my biggest  hardships of it were the nausea and the pain. The pain was caused from a needle  that I had to give myself. It was called Neulasta and it was to build up your  white blood cells, is that the right word blood cells?  <br />
	  I did have bad nausea for a day or two but other  than that is was good. I was able to do anything.  </p>
<p>That  drug that I had to give myself, the needle, it was interesting. I think it was  like 3 days after I would start getting a pain in the top of my head and it  would go down through the whole body and it lasted for a few days and it was  quite bad. It was all, it was at the same time as the nausea and things like  that too.</p>
