		<p>I was very fortunate with the chemo because a  lot of people said there&rsquo;s a lot of side-effects. So mostly, first of all, I  didn&rsquo;t feel too much nausea. It was there constantly but because I used to  sleep so much it didn&rsquo;t affect me as much and because I took my pills so much  on time. Consistently, 6 o&rsquo;clock in the morning, 6 o&rsquo;clock in the evening that  really helped me. So I was very consistent with my medication. Once chemo was  done, I got some... they say your nails turn black. Very, very little because (name)  was very good with me, they would give me a tub of ice and I put my fingers  through there and it would just help me. So at the end of the chemo there was  hardly any stuff. I saw some of the people who came for radiation, there was  one lady who had black all over and I asked her I said &ldquo;Why are your nails all  black?&rdquo; She said &ldquo;Well that&rsquo;s the hospital I go to and they&rsquo;re putting ice here  instead of&rdquo; and I said &ldquo;why would they do that?&rdquo; She says everyone of us has  all our nails have turned black. I was shocked so I was very fortunate, I went to  (name hospital) they looked after me, they told me to put them. So that was one  of the, one of the side-effects. The other side-effect was on the, I think, on  my last chemo after my last, after a week or so my legs really swelled up. She  said &quot;That&rsquo;s one of the side-effects.&quot;Â  And I had a tooth infection, so it&rsquo;s very  important that you always visit a dentist before you go through this and after.  So I had a tooth infection and had to extract my tooth actually because it was  so bad.</p>
