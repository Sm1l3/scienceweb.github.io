      <p>Then&nbsp;because I was  feeling fine after chemo, I delved right into radiation and that was a bit  trickier, only because you’re  at the hospital every day so it was, really challenging to try and be motivated  to go there for your 15 minutes and then leave and then know that you had to go  back and do it the next day. Especially because by that point in time I felt  like I was starting to get reinvigorated after chemo. You know it’s been a  couple of weeks, and normally that was when I would have to go back in for  chemo so my counts were starting to naturally increase. And so I was starting  to feel a bit more energetic and a bit more revived, but then I was still at  the hospital almost every day so that was a bit challenging.&nbsp; </p>
