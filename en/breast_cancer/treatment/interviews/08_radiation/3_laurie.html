      <p>And  then we had to decide about the radiation. They said that I should have  radiation both in the breast area and up here but I wasn&rsquo;t very keen  about this and I wasn&rsquo;t  very keen about going for 5 weeks every day. So I started to do some research  about the need or not need for radiation in the case of mastectomy, because a  lot of the current research is on breast conserving surgery, where they always  do radiation. And I wrote to some doctors in the United States and I wrote to the  surgeon who invented my procedure, and none of them seemed to think that I  should have radiation and my surgeon didn&rsquo;t  think I needed radiation. So then I sent the papers and my summary to the  radiation oncologist saying, &ldquo;We have an appointment coming up but this is what  I think and I thought maybe you should see me, about my surgery and stuff  before.&rdquo; And he wrote back to me, he said, &ldquo;Yeah,that makes sense but there are these two recent  studies,&rdquo; and  he gave me the names of the studies, &ldquo;That  would indicate that doing radiation even for mastectomy patients is worthwhile  so why don&rsquo;t  you look into these and then we&rsquo;ll  chat when we meet.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
So  I found yet a third PowerPoint presentation, not mine this time but one made by  a radiation oncologist in the United Kingdom that actually walked through these  two studies and came up with her summary of what the situation was and actually  her summary would also say I shouldn&rsquo;t have radiation. But we talked for over  an hour and we went through every study and we looked at whether it applied to  my situation or not and finally I said, &ldquo;Well could we come to a compromise and  only do the upper part and just leave the, what I call the baby bears because  it&rsquo;s the Goldilocks mastectomy, alone?&rdquo; Because no one knew what radiation  would do to these guys, and really, if you have radiation on the nodes,&nbsp; if  there&rsquo;s anything that&rsquo;s reached these nodes the idea is to zap it. And he said,  &ldquo;Well since you&rsquo;ve already gone on this strange path so far why not we can, we  can do something different for you for the radiation.&rdquo; And then I said, &ldquo;Well I&rsquo;ve heard that  sometimes you can do this in 3weeks instead of 5 weeks, where they give you  slightly more radiation per treatment.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Yeah, yeah we could do it in 3  weeks.&rdquo; So that&rsquo;s what we ended up doing, 3 weeks just on here and you can sort  of see, it&rsquo;s still a little bit red but not too much more red than this side.  So it&rsquo;s basically from here up to here and so far so good. I mean it&rsquo;s been  about almost a year now since my surgery and nothing&rsquo;s come back so far.&nbsp;
