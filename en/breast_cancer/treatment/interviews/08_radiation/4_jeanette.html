      <p>When you&rsquo;re finished your chemotherapy you ring a  little bell on your last day when you&rsquo;re leaving. So when I went downstairs to  do my radiation one of the radiation technicians was a male and he was there  every day for my 20 treatments except my very last day. On my very last day I&rsquo;m  laying on the table, he wasn&rsquo;t there, his wife was expecting a baby and I said,  &ldquo;Well he&rsquo;s not here, that&rsquo;s fine he has a job to do.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m laying on the table  for my last time and the tears were streaming down my eyes just because it&rsquo;s so  overwhelming, like this is it and now it&rsquo;s, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s next? What do I have to do  next?&rdquo; But as I come out of the radiation room, there he was standing there to  give me a big hug good-bye. I said that&rsquo;s so much better than ringing a bell  upstairs.&nbsp;</p>
