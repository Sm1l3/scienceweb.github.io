      <p>It does, yeah it does and they know it&rsquo;s a long-term  effect. Oncologists know it&rsquo;s a long-term effect. Researchers are now really  looking into it. We&rsquo;ve discussed this quite often on the Symptom Management  Committees for Cancer Care Ontario  and that&rsquo;s a huge topic right now for long-term survivors. Why do I still have  this? To be tired is one thing, you know you&rsquo;re tired, you get some sleep, you  get up the next day, you&rsquo;re fine or maybe 2 days, but to be fatigued is to just  not have energy. I was talking about it to my oncologist yesterday and I said  to him, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like if somebody calls you and says you have to get out, the  building&rsquo;s burning down.&rdquo; You want to say to them, &ldquo;Let me know when it&rsquo;s  closer.&rdquo; You know that sort of thing . It&rsquo;s just, you don&rsquo;t want to move, you  do not want to move and physically you feel like you cannot move. Whereas if I&rsquo;m  tired, I&rsquo;ll still go to the gym. If I&rsquo;m fatigued I cannot go to the gym.</p>
