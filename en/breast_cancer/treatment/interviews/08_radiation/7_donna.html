      <p>By  that time I had thought, I’m  pulling in some of my alternative care, so for skin care I made all of my own  blends. I made all my own moisturizers and I used essential oils and did  healing work. I went to a number of providers and did healing work. I went to  my naturopath and did vitamin C intravenous and I also did, I’ll probably  get it wrong, I’ll  just say ALAs (alpha linoleic acid) which helps with nerve damage and I’m trying to  think if there was anything else. And mistletoe I did mistletoe. So I did all  of those therapies along with the radiation. So I ended up with some burning on  my skin but no blistering and I have inflammation in the fascia now, which I’m going to  work with an osteopath to heal and so the radiation wasn’t as difficult  as I thought it would be and I was pleased with that. And the radiation  technologists were great so the staff was great.</p>
