      <p>I found  radiation was tough and I am so proud of myself that I started working right  away and my boss says I could come back part-time because during the chemo time  I got very depressed. It was during the Christmas time and it got me very  depressed and I couldn&rsquo;t I told my husband I can&rsquo;t stay at home during  radiation. So my husband says &ldquo;Okay so if you feel like it why don&rsquo;t you go to  work part-time?&rdquo; And so I asked my boss, my boss says &ldquo;Yeah sure whatever hours  you want to come in for 2 hours, 3 hours you pick your time.&rdquo; So I told him  &ldquo;I&rsquo;d come between 9 and 2.&rdquo; And he said that was fine. So it and you know what  it made me feel great because you know what I got control of my life. I got  into a routine I dressed up I put on a lipstick I wanted to look good and I  felt good. And you know what I was busy so I wouldn&rsquo;t think about my sickness  so and it gave me confidence, right. I went to work everybody was pleasant  there andÂ  then I would leave at 2 and I  booked my appointments for my radiation between 2:30 and 3:30 so and the  hospital is so close to my work it was four minutes. So I would go there do my  radiation and come home.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> It was quick in and  out. Was it everyday?</p>
      <p>It was  every single day, every single day and some days you know the machine wouldn&rsquo;t  work and there were some off days but most of them they were very good. And  then I would just come home and take a little nap then I&rsquo;d be fine and I&rsquo;m  ready to go to work and I did it for a whole month. And everybody told me after  the second week radiation you will not be able to go to work but I did it and I  am very proud of myself. </p>
