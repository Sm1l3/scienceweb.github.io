		<p>Again very manageable,  sort of like temperature changes, but very manageable. So I wouldn’t fear the  tamoxifen, as drugs go, it’s a tried and true, it’s cheap and it seems to do  the job. It is a drug that has definitively been shown to stop cancer  occurrence and we don’t have very many of those on the market.  It’s a goody. You know, I’ve never taken a  pill every day in my life so that kind of bugged me. I find that intrusive but  I have to get off that.</p>
        <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> For how long are you going to take the  hormones?</p>
        <p>The protocol now is 5  years but there’s been evidence that 10 years as well may be the way to go, so  I think you start on the 5 and then you see how you’re doing. It is effective  for sure for hormone sensitive tumours, so you do it, you do it for sure. And  the side-effects for most people, I think, are quite, quite minimal and for me,  really, they’re almost non-significant.</p>
