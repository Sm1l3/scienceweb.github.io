      <p>I&rsquo;m taking tamoxifen.Â  Actually a lot of people stop taking  tamoxifen because of the side-effects. And this, I don&rsquo;t understand, because  everyone&rsquo;s perfectly happy to do chemo, like they&rsquo;re told do chemo and they say,  &ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;ll do chemo,&rdquo; and they&rsquo;re sick like dogs for 6 months but they&rsquo;ll do  that but then people take tamoxifen, they get a few side-effects, and they stop  taking it. Whereas actually the effect of the tamoxifen is equally important so  why is that?</p>
      <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Maybe it&rsquo;s also the time, like you have to  take it for 5 years?</p>
      <p>I know, but the amount  of distress in that 5 years can&rsquo;t be equivalent to the amount of distress of  doing chemo. So I know I have to take it because that&rsquo;s one of the most beneficial  things.</p>
