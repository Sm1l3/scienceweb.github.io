      <p>Five years of  Letrozole, which is challenging. It&rsquo;s giving me hot flashes and they say  there&rsquo;s joint and muscle pain as a possible side-effect but if I phone about it  and say that I&rsquo;m having joint and muscle pain, then they tell me I&rsquo;ve probably  got arthritis; possible osteoporosis and high cholesterol are all possible  outcomes. I already have high cholesterol and I talked with my doctor before  when they found this out and I had decided not to do medication to deal with it  and that I would deal with it through diet and exercise and things like  that.Â  So when the medical oncologist  told me that high cholesterol was a possible problem and I said &ldquo;I already had  high cholesterol&rdquo;, he said, &ldquo;Well just take medication for it.&rdquo; And I said,  &ldquo;Well I don&rsquo;t want to take medication,&rdquo; and he said, &ldquo;Well you have to.&rdquo; So  it&rsquo;s just, they&rsquo;re so entrenched in the medical model that it becomes a  challenge.</p>
