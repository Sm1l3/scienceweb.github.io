		<p>So I felt so much  better once I got off tamoxifen and I went through the summer and then I went  back to see her.  At the beginning I was  going every 4 months and then she said, &ldquo;Okay, well now do you want to try it  again?&rdquo; And I said, &ldquo;Well not really &rdquo; and she said, &ldquo;Well that&rsquo;s your choice,  it&rsquo;s your choice but if you don&rsquo;t go back on it, I won&rsquo;t be your doctor  anymore.&rdquo; So then I&rsquo;m like, &ldquo;Oh okay.&rdquo; I was a little bit upset about that and  then I went to speak to my naturopath and he said, &ldquo;Well first of all, she&rsquo;s  not allowed to do that. That&rsquo;s been tried in times past and apparently that&rsquo;s  been to the Supreme Court, and it&rsquo;s illegal to fire a patient for making a  choice that you offer them. I don&rsquo;t know if this is true or not but this is  what I was told. Anyway I was pretty comfortable with my decision and I was  like, &ldquo;Well I don&rsquo;t really need her, she doesn&rsquo;t do anything anyway and she  said,&quot; If you ever have a problem I&rsquo;ll see you right away. You have a  family doctor, you have a surgeon, if you need me it&rsquo;s not like I won&rsquo;t help  you but if you&rsquo;re not going to comply,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I have liability insurance  issues I can&rsquo;t be your doctor.&rdquo; So I said, &ldquo;Okay that&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; and then we  agreed, I think, that I&rsquo;d see her again and in the meantime I did some reading  and then I thought, &ldquo;Well you know what maybe I will try tamoxifen one more  time.&rdquo; So I tried it again and  I committed to myself that I would do it for 3  months and she was pretty happy that I would try that and then it went really  badly again but it wasn&rsquo;t fatigue so much as I got this terrible anxiety.  Again, I had the other things like I lost my appetite and I lost weight and I  had dry eyes  and a few other things  I can&rsquo;t even remember but I had this terrible anxiety and I just I didn&rsquo;t want  to live that way. And so I stopped after 3 months and immediately again I felt  way better without it, so now that&rsquo;s  not something I will consider, but then she did offer to remove my ovaries for  me so I could take something different.   I said,&rdquo; Well I would consider that, but maybe we could try chemical  suppression and try this new drug,   because if tamoxifen made me feel terrible, and I can&rsquo;t live like that,  if you take out my ovaries and it does the same thing there&rsquo;s no way to fix it  so I don&rsquo;t really want you ripping out my ovaries.&rdquo; So she again didn&rsquo;t really  like that and I think you can tell I&rsquo;m not so keen on my oncologist. </p>
