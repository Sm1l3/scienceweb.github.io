		<p>So they decided they  wouldn&rsquo;t give it to me the second time so they put me on that Arimidex for 6 years  and there&rsquo;s no studies on that either. It&rsquo;s usuallyÂ  five, and I was on it for six and some doctor  came down from (city in Alberta) at the Cancer Clinic and talked to me and he  said, &ldquo; What treatment?&rdquo; and he says, &ldquo;No stop.&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;Stop, Yeah don&rsquo;t  take it anymore.&rdquo; &ldquo;So okay good for me,&rdquo; I said because did have a lot of side-effects, you know, diarrhoea isn&rsquo;t pleasant and vomiting and the shakes and the  headaches and all sorts of stuff.</p>
        <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> How did you manage to continue if you had so  many bad side-effects?</p>
        <p>Interviewee: I&rsquo;m very  stubborn and you know I thought well, if this is going to stop the cancer from  coming back I&rsquo;ll go through it I just got on with it. It was mainly in the  morning when I took it but I was in pain and distress for 6 years. It&rsquo;s a way  of life. You can get used to anything and maybe I was too dumb to go and say I  can&rsquo;t take this anymore but no I just put up with it.        </p></div>
