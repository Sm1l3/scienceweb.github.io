      <p>So when I met with  the medical oncologist he outlined the treatment plan for me, talked to me  about a chemotherapy plan and how long it would take and I told him I would  think about it and then left it at that. I&rsquo;m quite into natural medicine and  alternative therapies and I wanted to do some investigation that way. I  actually started to see a naturopath and started to do vitamin C intravenous  and started to take some supplements and with a number of alternative  caregivers. My children were quite upset with that and wanted me to do the  medical treatment and so we, had a lot of discussions about that, a lot of hard  discussions and then I agreed. I said &ldquo;Okay we would do it.&rdquo; I thought I didn&rsquo;t  want to leave any stone unturned. I was doing a number of natural treatments  and thought it would complement the medical treatment.</p>
