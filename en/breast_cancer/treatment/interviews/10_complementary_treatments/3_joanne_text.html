		<p>I tried, well the tingling like... I couldn’t be anywhere and I was going like this... my hands were all like..... I tried everything to try and get rid of that. I went to a chiropractor, I went to physio. Well I went to physio first for my arm anyway, for my lymph nodes that were removed, so I went to physiotherapy but only in the beginning, post-surgery, to get the movement back. I tried massage back then and then I stopped for a while. I went to a chiropractor to see if he could help with the nerve damage stuff but no. He told me it’s not going to help, you should try massage again. Try deep tissue massage and that really does help. Other than that no I didn’t go to anything else.</p>
