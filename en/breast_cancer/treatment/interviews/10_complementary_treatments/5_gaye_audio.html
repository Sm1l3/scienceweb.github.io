		<p>And I feel very badly  for women who are really upset about it because I do know women who have  survived years after breast cancer and it can happen for all of us. The only  thing I can say about having  my TRAM flap*(Transverse Rectus Abdominis Muscle Flap) is that I don’t know  whether it made my stomach smaller or whether it’s just, I didn’t eat a lot  while I was on chemo I can’t eat a lot at one time. I eat lots during the day,  like I pick during the day because I cannot eat a big meal at once. I can have  a little bowl of cereal or I can have a piece of cake or something but I don’t  eat a lot and plus I don’t have any taste buds. My, I was hoping and I’ve asked  three doctors but they will not prescribe marijuana and so I have some on the  side but I don’t smoke it enough because I forget. I’ll lie in bed and think &quot;Oh  I should have a joint.&quot; But because all it does is I’ll smoke it and then  it makes me tired and I’ll go to bed and have a good sleep. And I find that the  first day my mouth is really smoky, the second day I can actually taste  something for the first time. I had one I couldn’t believe it because I was  eating a spinach and feta pizza and I could actually taste the feta and I was  so excited that I could actually taste something. But I need to do that more  and I think that marijuana should be legalized and I think that Trudeau is on  the right track because I do not think that it’s a bad thing.</p>

<p><em><strong>Interviewer</strong></em>: And then  it improves your taste sensation. </p>
<p>Yes, yes it does, one  of the fellas I work with is a scientist and he had gotten this information and  gave it to me and I do have information on that if you want it, it says that it  does.</p>
        <p>So I’m going to see,  apparently you can get something that you can put the marijuana in and then you  can inhale it and you don’t get that smoke and so I’m going to see if I can find  one of these little machines and try that. I think that marijuana should be,  and I think that if it is beneficial, that it should be allowed and I know that  some doctors will give you a prescription.</p>
