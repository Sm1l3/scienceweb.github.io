      <p>Yes since then, and  so I really sort of appreciated the time she spent with me. One of the other  things I found was, I had told the doctors that I was doing some of these other  therapies and they were very adamant that if I was going to do anything like  that I needed to check with the department first. And so anything that I was  doing, I would phone and say I want to do the vitamin C intravenous and it was &quot;No  you can’t do that blah, blah, blah for this reason, that reason and the other  reason.&quot; And then I would say well there was something else I was taking,  I was taking dulse and seaweed, &quot;No you can’t take that.&quot; And so it  didn’t matter what I consulted with them about they just said no.</p>
      <p><strong>Interviewer: </strong>Nurses  and doctors?</p>
      <p>Nurses and doctors.  So I found they weren’t open to complementary therapy at all. I know there’s  alternative and complementary and so I wanted to combine them as a  complementary therapy and they were not open to it at all, even though all of  the literature said and all of the statements said that they were open to  complementary therapies, I found it wasn’t the case. And unfortunately, I  stopped going to my naturopath during the chemotherapy because I trusted that  they knew what they were talking about. I found out later that it would have  been very helpful for me to continue with the naturopath that it would have  supported the journey a lot, made it a lot easier.</p>
      <p>The radiation  oncologist and the medical oncologist, but it seemed that every time I phoned  about something they would say &quot;Oh no that’s not this, it’s got to be  something else.&quot; So I was experiencing a lot of pain in my collarbone here,  and phoned about it and was told that radiation doesn’t cause bone pain, I must  have arthritis. And when I met with the osteopath last week, they explained it,  no it doesn’t cause bone pain but it causes inflammation in the fascia, which  pulls on the bones, which hurts. So I don’t know why I didn’t get that  information from the oncology department it would have been helpful. Part of it  was feeling that when I would call with something it just felt very dismissive.</p>
