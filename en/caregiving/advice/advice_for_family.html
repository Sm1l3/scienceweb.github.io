<h1>Advice for friends and family</h1>

<p>The support caregivers received from their family  and friends varied a lot amongst the people we interviewed. At one end, some had  reliable people that provided practical and moral support in a variety of ways.  At the other end, some received no support or understanding at all. This was  sometimes a sensitive and emotional issue for these caregivers. Some were in  difficult situations with their family; others simply had no friends or family  available to help. Some caregivers were also less comfortable than others when it came to  asking for help or accepting it. In general, even a little bit of help was  better than no help. We asked all participants what advice they would give to  family and friends of caregivers who are caring for a chronically ill person. In  particular, the caregivers spoke about how family and friends could best offer  their help. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Offers  that caregivers appreciated</h2>
<p>Caregivers especially appreciated practical,  reliable, and steady help offered by family and friends. Richard advised that  friends and family listen to the caregiver and identify some positive things, or  a specific action, they can do for them. Richard&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s friends once came  over as a surprise and did a spring cleaning. Like Richard, many caregivers  were pleased with specific actions or help that people offered.</p>

<p>The people we interviewed gave many practical  suggestions on what kind of help people can offer. Anne&rsquo;s husband&rsquo;s cousin came  to stay with Anne&rsquo;s husband so that she could go away for two days. Anne suggested that people  can come over and socialize with the care recipient, but they should bring  dinner so that they give a real break to the caregiver. With regards to the  children of the caregiver, you could offer to do activities such as taking the  children out, bringing them for a picnic, a sleepover, or offer to bring the children  to their sports activities. </p>

<p>Other specific recommendations were to bring  dinner, do grocery shopping for the caregiver, help in the care for the care  recipient, help with cleaning, and help with transport to medical appointments  or errands. Mrs. Smith  described how a family could work as a unit to help each other. And Shayna  recommended scheduling caregiving time among the family so that the caregiver  could plan to do something constructive. For some caregivers, keeping a list of  ideas of ways others can help them would be useful.</p>
<p>It is particularly helpful when people specify what they are willing and  able to do, and perhaps unable to do. Rowdyneko explained that the burden of  the caregiving is so high that, often, she cannot plan ahead in terms of what she  needs: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what today&rsquo;s date is, much less what I might need help  with.&rdquo; Other caregivers described that it is hard to reach out to friends and  family even when they have offered help. Shayna advised people who are offering  help to not pull back once the offer is on the table. This will make it even  harder for the caregiver to ask for help again. One way to decide what kind of  help to offer is to think what you would need yourself if you were in a similar  situation&mdash;or, as Claire suggests, don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask how you can help.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Socializing  with the caregiver and care recipient</h2>
<p>Caregivers typically experience a significant negative  impact on their social lives, and become less visible in social settings. For  example, several caregivers mentioned that when they  meet people, the attention is usually turned towards the sick person and how  they are doing. Caregivers appreciated it when people took an interest in them  and asked, &ldquo;And how are <strong>you</strong> doing&rdquo;? </p>
<p>Caregivers or their care recipients may not be able  to participate in many social events, and this can have a significant impact on  their lives. Caregivers suggested that people should continue to call them, go for  walks with them, pop over and make a tea, or simply visit the caregiver. Lorna,  for example, appreciates it when people are just there for her and have a  listening ear.</p>

<p>Some caregivers ask that  friends and families be careful not to criticize or judge the caregiver.  Christine said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t judge. Because you don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like until you  are actually living it. Don&rsquo;t  criticize [a caregiver]. You have to help them and acknowledge that they&rsquo;re  doing something important, and that it means a lot to you that the caregiver is  caring for someone you love too.&rdquo;</p>
