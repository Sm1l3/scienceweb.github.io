		<p>One main thing is&mdash;I&rsquo;ve been hearing it  for years&mdash;you&rsquo;ve got to start as early as you can in looking after yourself,  because if you don&rsquo;t look after yourself then you&rsquo;re not going to be very good  at looking after somebody else. That&rsquo;s a clich&eacute;. It really is a clich&eacute;. And  other people that I know in this one support group, they are able to look after  themselves. They&rsquo;re more independent, they&rsquo;re more assertive&mdash;much more  assertive&mdash;and they do things on their own, which I have great deal difficulty doing  as I mentioned. So anyway, the key is you&rsquo;ve got to look after yourself; make  sure that you don&rsquo;t let yourself get totally swamped because if you let  yourself get totally swamped and stressed out, then you are not going to be  able to do a very good job of looking after your person&mdash;the care receiver.</p>
