		<p>Yeah don&rsquo;t be stubborn like I was; don&rsquo;t turn down help. Never dismiss the idea that you&rsquo;ll never get burned out, because it does happen. If you are a 24/7  caregiver and if you put into it as much as I do you will get burned out and you won&rsquo;t know it. Don&rsquo;t listen to your spouse if they&rsquo;re refusing homecare; just do it. It really is nice, mind you, I don&rsquo;t care for homecare that well because then it means I have to leave the house. And also with homecare, if they send you a different person every time, then you just can&rsquo;t leave the home and leave a complete stranger in your home while you take off and go do shopping. You have to take this person through a half an hour to an hour orientation, telling them you know what he&rsquo;s not supposed to be doing or what  he&rsquo;s supposed to be doing. Like, the rule in this house is he stays out of the cupboards, he stays out of the refrigerator, because he&rsquo;s ripped doors off cupboards&mdash;things like that&mdash;and then it&rsquo;s cost me $60 to get them repaired. He&rsquo;s not allowed to go into the bathroom by himself because he&rsquo;ll fall down, or get naughty. And so, [&hellip;]it&rsquo;s amazing when you&rsquo;re dealing with a new person and you have to tell them what you know in a short period of time so that things don&rsquo;t go awry while you&rsquo;re gone. I mean it&rsquo;s not any different than you leaving a child with a babysitter. You don&rsquo;t leave your child with a complete stranger, do you? And you&rsquo;re sure not going to let your child run amuck in your home either.</p>
