		<p>I would love it if healthcare  professionals had at their fingertips almost a package of &ldquo;Okay here, you are a caregiver. Here are options for you of places to go and places to ask for help; some of them are online, some of them are support groups in town, [&hellip;] or an agency that&rsquo;s able to link you up with all of these things.&rdquo; And if a physician can help you recognize yourself as being a caregiver, because so many times you&rsquo;re a daughter or a wife or a husband or a whatever, and you forget that link that you can be a caregiving daughter, or a caregiving wife. And sometimes it takes a physician to say those words. So yeah, I would love physicians and medical office assistants to have a package like that; to have posters in their office about &ldquo;Are you a family caregiver?&rdquo; &ldquo;Do you give care to a neighbour, a relative, a friend who is frail, has a disability? Are you taking them meals, are you doing their banking? Then you are a caregiver and here&rsquo;s a list of  organizations that you can contact to help you out with that.&rdquo;Â That&rsquo;s probably one of the biggest things.</p>
