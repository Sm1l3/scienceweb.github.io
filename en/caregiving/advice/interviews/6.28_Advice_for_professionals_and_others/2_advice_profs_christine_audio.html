		<p>So I think it should be once someone has a chronic illness or is in need of the caregiver&mdash;has a caregiver&mdash;I think that not only should the person who is ill get the help and the doctors involved and nurses and social support&mdash;the social services&mdash;but I think when they realize there&rsquo;s a caregiver involved, I would hope that  sometime, some day, right away, it would be an automatic thing: &ldquo;Well, these are the services available for the person you&rsquo;re caring with, but also these are the services available for you that are very important.&rdquo; Because you always hear that. You always hear, &ldquo;Oh, you can&rsquo;t do it alone.&rdquo; You can&rsquo;t, and you don&rsquo;t realize it until either you&rsquo;re right in it and you don&rsquo;t know where to turn, or it&rsquo;s too late. And I&rsquo;m not saying like I&rsquo;m over, my life is over. To  me, I&rsquo;m just restarting my life, or building up my life again. But I became very sick as a caregiver and I didn&rsquo;t get that support that all caregivers should get. Never mind like getting some kind of financial help, just the recognition and everyone says it. </p>
