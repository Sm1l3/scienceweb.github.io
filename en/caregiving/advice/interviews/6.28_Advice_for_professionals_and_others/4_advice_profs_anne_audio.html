		<p>And talk to the caretakers about finding  time, or help them find time, that they can get away and get a break so they don&rsquo;t have a breakdown. And the thing is, I realize too because my mother-in-law&mdash;oh no, my dad&rsquo;s second wife, yeah&mdash;she had the exact same thing happen to her that happened to me. Because she ended up in the hospital and I asked her what happened and it was exactly the same thing. She just kind of had a stress breakdown because she was looking after my dad who was really sick; she had to keep taking him to the hospital and all this, and I think that happens to people quite often. They get to a point they&rsquo;ve just had it, and that  happens to them. And that caregiver&hellip; the professionals should talk to people about that kind of stuff&mdash;to watch out, what to watch out for, make sure that they take breaks every once in a while, and also maybe look at the family a bit closer to see that the kids don&rsquo;t suffer because of all this…that they’re going through too. There&rsquo;s so many levels to this thing, because I know it&rsquo;s had an impact on my kids definitely.</p>
