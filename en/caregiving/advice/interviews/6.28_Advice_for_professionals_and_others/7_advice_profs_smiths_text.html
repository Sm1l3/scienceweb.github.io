		<p>And there&rsquo;s nonsense of reassessing and assessing and assessing, that should be done with. It should be one assessment and that&rsquo;s it. And somebody should  follow that, and then they can see the difference. See, if somebody drops somebody on you, you don&rsquo;t know how she was before and after because you never seen her before. And that&rsquo;s why they fouled up in the hospital, because an old bitty in a wheelchair was rolled in there. &ldquo;Well yeah, she&rsquo;s very old and she doesn&rsquo;t talk much English.&rdquo; Well, most of them, you don&rsquo;t speak English, right? [&hellip;]</p>
        <p>But when my mother-in-law got into the hospital for a stroke, we could see the difference of course, right? But they can&rsquo;t. So, they didn&rsquo;t catch on that fast,  and it was a light stroke so you don&rsquo;t see it. And, if a single person was a case manager there, they could have seen the difference from now, before, and after, and she could say, &ldquo;Okay, something is happening, and something needs to  happen.&rdquo; And that person should be able to direct the care and make it happen. And that more or less happened with my mom in Holland, and I thought it was actually really&hellip; that was actually quite smart how that went there. </p>
        <p>Well, it would take off a ton of our stress. Now we were able to deal with it, but I&rsquo;m sure a lot of people won&rsquo;t be able to look after this like we did, right. And well, good luck them. If you sit in a wheelchair, good luck to you. You are going to suffer.</p>
