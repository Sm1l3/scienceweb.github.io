		<p>Oh a friend that will come over and say,  &ldquo;[My husband] always wants to clean out his eaves troughs. Have you had them done lately?&rdquo; And I&rsquo;ll say, &ldquo;No,&rdquo; and boom they&rsquo;re doing it. I&rsquo;m a very proud person and when I&rsquo;ve got somebody phoning and saying, &ldquo;Tell me what I can do for you,&rdquo; I very often say, &ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s nothing. I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s those simple things that kind of get overwhelming. You can go for a long time, and I can keep up with the yard as best I can. And I mean, things slip; they&rsquo;re definitely the standards slip, but that&rsquo;s okay. That&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
        <p>But my daughter will come over and she&rsquo;ll  just start doing the dishes if they&rsquo;re in the sink. She&rsquo;ll go into the bathroom and see if it needs freshening upâ€”boom it&rsquo;s done. I don&rsquo;t have to ask for those  things. And for a person who needs help, for them not to have to ask, it is the best gift of all. So anybody that can just show up&mdash;even bring something that you&rsquo;ve cooked, or phone and &ldquo;I&rsquo;m at the grocery store. Do you need milk? I&rsquo;ll bring it right over.&rdquo; Yeah, that&rsquo;s an easy thing for me to say. &ldquo;Yes, we don&rsquo;t have any milk,&rdquo; or juice, or bread, or whatever. That&rsquo;s very helpful. I&rsquo;m always telling my caregivers, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask.&rdquo; And then lots of times  I&rsquo;m just as bad; I don&rsquo;t ask. But I&rsquo;m asking my kids now more than I ever did.</p>
