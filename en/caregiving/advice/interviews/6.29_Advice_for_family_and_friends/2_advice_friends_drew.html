So, not involved in the care situation, but definitely can be involved in the caregiving situation; i.e. recognizing that if I have to miss a&hellip; if I miss a family dinner, it&rsquo;s okay. Don&rsquo;t take it personally; it&rsquo;s because of what&rsquo;s going on, or it&rsquo;s because the power went out, or whatever it may be.  And so, providing support that way to the family caregiver, I think, is something that is probably the most valuable advice I could think of to give to the family and friends of that caregiver.

Because it means that is one less thing I have to now  obsess about missing out or sacrificing that affects another person.</p>
