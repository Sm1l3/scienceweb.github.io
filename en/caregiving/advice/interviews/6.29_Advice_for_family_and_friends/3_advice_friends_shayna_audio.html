		<p>Yes. What is helpful is specifics. Don&rsquo;t say, &ldquo;If you need me, call me,&rdquo; because the caregiver probably will not call unless they&rsquo;re older, and it&rsquo;s not taken as a sincere invitation. It just isn&rsquo;t. Calling up and saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m bringing dinner at 7 o&rsquo;clock, let me know if it&rsquo;s inconvenient?&rdquo; Or before, as I said, my son&hellip; my husband was in the  hospital in intensive care before my son&rsquo;s wedding, and a friend came over&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll never forget this&mdash;and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not leaving until you give me a list of things to do. I know you must be going crazy for the wedding. You give me a list, and I will just take care of it.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>You need to be specific. Take the children out. We were a religious family, so we sit separate in synagogue. If  my husband couldn&rsquo;t go to synagogue, my son was alone. So unless somebody is there to be a pseudo parent, it&rsquo;s horrendous, it&rsquo;s horrendous for the child. If somebody isn&rsquo;t willing to be a big brother, or &ldquo;come with my family,&rdquo; or whatever in terms of worship, in terms of the holidays. Be specific. Think of what&rsquo;s not happening and offer that. You&rsquo;re going grocery shopping; call up, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m at the store. What can I pick up for you?&rdquo; &ldquo;Can I do your car pool?&rdquo; Or get together with a group if there are young children. That would have meant the world to me&mdash;that car pool on top of delivering my husband to work and getting myself to work. It doesn&rsquo;t even have to be all the time, just once in a while. I remember once, I had gotten my husband in the car and I was struggling to get the wheelchair in the trunk before we had the accessible van, and a stranger came by and said, &ldquo;Please let me do that for you.&rdquo; No one had ever done that for me. I just stood there. The feeling, the euphoria I got because someone  picked up this wheelchair. Just look and see what&rsquo;s going on. Carry groceries into the house. There&rsquo;s so many little ways you can help a family in this  situation. You just have to look and think, &ldquo;What would I do in this situation? What would I need in this situation?&rdquo; But be specific and don&rsquo;t give the onus to the caregiver. &ldquo;Call me if you need something.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s horrendous.</p>
