		<p>Other caregivers, I&rsquo;d say avoid it like the plague. Oh, it&rsquo;s probably the worst thing I&rsquo;ve ever done. It&rsquo;s just because it&rsquo;s so much not my personality. I shouldn&rsquo;t say that; it&rsquo;s totally  discombobulated my life. I think for friends and family though, to stay in contact because sometimes I just don&rsquo;t have time, or sometimes I am just feeling so overwhelmed by things that I go to ground. Like, I just don&rsquo;t have the energy to phone someone. I don&rsquo;t have the energy to reach out to someone, but on the other hand, if someone was to pop over and make me tea, or phone me up and say, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go for a walk,&rdquo; I would be probably really happy to do that.  But I don&rsquo;t find people do that. Maybe it&rsquo;s just the people I hang out with. And that could be because, again, I&rsquo;ve always been a fiercely independent person and I think maybe some people are afraid to step past that now because they know I&rsquo;m really independent.</p>
