        <div class="text" style="width:500px; height:280px; float:left;">
	<p>Don&rsquo;t exclude the couple because of a  physical barrier like if that person was in a wheelchair and they can&rsquo;t get in your home. Perhaps you could spend time in the yard. They could possibly get in your yard for the evening instead of inside the home if there&rsquo;s steps involved, washroom problems, that type of thing. Let them say no. Offer it. Let them say  no. Let them decide if they want to attempt this. </p>
        <p>And if it&rsquo;s not possible for the ill person, don&rsquo;t discount the well spouse. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re having this get together with so and so and so and so. If your husband isn&rsquo;t able to come, would you like to come?&rdquo; Let that person decide if they want to join in. A lot of people aren&rsquo;t comfortable going solo, but some people are, and don&rsquo;t make that decision for them. Invite them. Let them decide and let them say yes, or let them say no. Don&rsquo;t  exclude them. Invite them out to a movie or whatever without the spouse. Give them some time to have some social life separated from the ill spouse as well. I think you need that interaction as well. I find it&rsquo;s very hard to get an ill spouse out to go for coffee with someone else. Whereas a well spouse would  probably love the idea of getting invited out to do something away from the home.</p>
