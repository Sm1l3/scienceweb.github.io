	  <p>And actually, I joke about that, but it&rsquo;s true. Actually, one of Luke&rsquo;s family members just bought an accessible home and  she was just about to move in in about a month. And that was one of the biggest thrills of our life because there&rsquo;s only two other family members&rsquo; home out of all of our extended family that we can get into. So, we&rsquo;re just excited to be able to go have shared experiences and spend time with them. So, we joke about that because we know most people can&rsquo;t switch homes, but actually it&rsquo;s a big  deal to have an accessible home or to find a wayâ€”to try and find a way. And I think too, when we can&rsquo;t come to certain things, trying to find ways to make up  for it by having a meal out, or I often say&mdash;no one has taken me up on this, but&mdash;our friends often say, &ldquo;Oh, we wish we could have you over for dinner,&rdquo; because that&rsquo;s one thing I miss is I never get to go to someone else&rsquo;s house for dinner and have them make us dinner, right. And I would like to do that, and so I tell them make dinner and bring it here, and that&rsquo;ll be your way of having us over for dinner. But that hasn&rsquo;t happened. So, if any of them watch this, it&rsquo;s a hint taken.</p>
