		<p>Well it&rsquo;s a combination of things, I think. One is definitely just listen and speak to the caregiver&mdash;because we&rsquo;re focusing on caregivers here&mdash;and let them talk, and don&rsquo;t offer solutions. I have one friend who was very big into complimentary or alternative medicine and every other week he would tell me, &ldquo;Have you tried this for Vivienne or that?&rdquo; And finally one day I said to him, &ldquo;I know you mean well, but if our doctors had heard about this, they would have told us by now. It would have been written up. And she has a chronic illness; she&rsquo;s not going to get better.&rdquo; And I might have said to him, but I didn&rsquo;t, &ldquo;I refuse to feel guilty for not going to the ends of the earth to try and cure her,&rdquo; which I guess he thought he was trying to do for me.</p>
