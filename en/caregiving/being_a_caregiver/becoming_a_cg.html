<h1><strong>Becoming a caregiver</strong></h1>


<p>We interviewed 37 people who were, or had been taking care of  someone with a chronic illness or condition. About half of the caregivers we  interviewed were caring for their husbands and some were caring for their wives. Several caregivers were  caring for a parent and others were caring for an adult child or a friend. </p>
<p>The caregivers had many  different stories about how they became a caregiver. Some people started caregiving  for a friend or a loved one after a sudden event like an accident or a severe illness.  Many people took on a role as a caregiver more gradually, as their care recipient was diagnosed with an  illness that progressed more slowly. Still some people only met their care  recipient after they were affected by their illness; these people knew they  were accepting the responsibilities of a caregiver when they became friends or  partners.</p>
<p>Some people remembered a specific  moment when their caregiving had started. For example, Donovan felt that the caregiving started when  his wife, diagnosed with MS, started using a wheelchair. </p>

<p>Marlyn&rsquo;s first major  caregiving effort was when they moved to an adapted home and she had to pack  everything alone. Many other caregivers felt that their role gradually increased  over time; there was not really a single point in time where they could say  they had become a caregiver. </p>
<p>Several caregivers said that they never chose to be a  caregiver, but &ldquo;became&rdquo;  a caregiver because of the situation they were in. David, for example, said, &ldquo;Well, this whole thing  started not with me as being a caregiver because you become a caregiver; a  caregiver is somebody who helps out, but it&rsquo;s not ever really a job that you  apply for.&rsquo; </p>
<p>Others felt it was something that came from  within. You can read more about this in the topic page <a href="uncovering_why.html">Uncovering why and how caregivers care</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Different family contexts'</h2>
<p>The people we interviewed came  from a diverse set of family backgrounds with different living arrangements,  and family sizes. Caregivers were at different stages of their lives and had  different sorts of relationships to their care recipient. Some were caring for  a parent; others cared for a spouse, a child, or a friend. A few people were  young adults or had young children when they became caregivers.</p>

  <p>Shoshana saw a similar  re action with her husband,  as soon as he was told he had MS. After his diagnosis, they started their  family and had two children. </p>
<p> Most caregivers either had no children or their children  had already grown up when they started caring.</p>

<p>Marc,  who started as a paid caregiver for the son of an elderly couple, said, &ldquo;&nbsp;It happens fast. As the years go by, it becomes  friendship, a strong friendship. And he is someone that inspires me a lot; I  would have difficulties to go on without this person.&rdquo; Marc  now lives together with his wife and the friend he cares for in an apartment. Rhyannan  started caring for the son of a deceased friend because she knew that there was  no family around to care for him.</p>

  <h2>Caring at a young age</h2>
  <p>Some  caregivers were younger than 18 years old when they became caregivers. We  interviewed 5 people who were or had been &ldquo;youth caregivers&quot;. Snoopey is a young caregiver and has cared for her  mother for many years. In addition to this big responsibility, she has her own personal  challenges: &ldquo;As  far as I know, I&rsquo;m on the borderline of being mentally retarded. I was tested a  few years ago and they said that upstairs is a 12-year-old&mdash;I have a mind of a  12-year-old&mdash;and that I can never live by myself.&rdquo;</p>

  <h2>Caring at a distance</h2>
  <p>Some caregivers helped to look  after someone who lived far away. It became a challenge to know exactly what  was happening and caregivers often felt more comfortable about the situation  when they visited, sometimes staying for longer periods of time.</p>
