		<p>So I got a phone call from my brother in  [city in the US] and he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m flying out to a small town, […] near [city  in AB]. Dad has had a heart attack,&rdquo; or something to that nature. Now, I had  thought that dad had had a heart attack a few years back, probably 10 or 15  more years back. So I thought, &ldquo;Hmm, okay this is maybe a second one. Maybe  this is time to go out and see what&rsquo;s going on.&rdquo; <br />
		  <br />
	    So the family was quite disjointed. I  wanted to meet up with him; he just wanted to leave and get there. So I  arranged a flight and I got out there, but I decided to take an aunt with me,  which I thought was a good idea because I hadn&rsquo;t seen my mom and dad for a  little while. We were in contact through the years for Christmas and stuff, and  I&rsquo;d go out with my daughter to visit on the farm. But I thought it would be  nice to bring someone as a support person maybe, because sometimes these things  don&rsquo;t turn out the way you think they&rsquo;re going to turn out. So, I brought my  aunt with me as a companion in a way. We met up with my other aunt and uncle  who are very close to me in [a city in AB] and drove to [a town in AB]. It&rsquo;s  just a small town outside of [a city in AB] and we were immediately met at the  desk. I&rsquo;d also been told that my mother was in the hospital as well, with  pneumonia. So, there was a lot of stuff going on. When I hit the desk, the  nurses were kind of evasive and me, [having] a professional nurse background, I  kind of got a sense something was wrong. <br />
	    <br />
	    So [the nurse] said to me, &ldquo;Your dad is  near the desk,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Your dad; do you know what&rsquo;s wrong with your dad?&rdquo; I said,  &ldquo;Apparently he&rsquo;s had a heart attack.&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;Well, your mother is here too,&rdquo;  and I said, &ldquo;Well let&rsquo;s start with the better one&rdquo;. She started with my mother  so that was odd. She said, &ldquo;Well, your mother&rsquo;s doing well, she&rsquo;s up with a  walker, she&rsquo;s had blah, blah, blah, pneumonia. She has COPD already…&rdquo; and okay  that was fine. My dad, she said, &ldquo;Your dad had a stroke; he&rsquo;s had a heart  attack,&rdquo; and whatever. I stood  there in shock.</p>
