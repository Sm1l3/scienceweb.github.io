		<p>He was about in his early 50s and my mom  and I had to go away for a few days for a conference and I came back. And the  situation was getting worse. So we took him to the hospital. Actually, we took  him to his doctor&rsquo;s first and, as good as they could, they gave him a clean  bill of health. Well, for his conditions that was as clean as it was going to  get. And then, that very night we took him and we found out that he had—we  didn&rsquo;t know about the condition of heart failure at first—but we found out that  he had several silent heart attacks. <br />
		  <br />
Right away it was a frustrating  experience because we just saw the doctor and she didn&rsquo;t see anything wrong  with him. Not that she gave him any x-rays, but I would have assumed that she  would have caught onto that. And then a few days later I was at school and I  got pulled out of the classroom and was told by the nurse that my father had a  heart attack. <br />
<br />
Just getting to the hospital was about  half an hour away and just nerve racking— &ldquo;am I going to make it? If he dies is  he going to be by himself?&rdquo; So it was a very nerve racking half an hour ride,  and when we got there, it was not fatal; he was going to be good. But, more or  less, that was when the youth-caregiving experience began.</p>
