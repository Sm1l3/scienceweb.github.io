		<p>And my husband had various testing and  things. They said the lungs were clear and there didn&rsquo;t seem to be any problems  so you should go to the heart specialist. It took many months to get to the  heart specialist, and we finally got there. He said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not your heart; your  heart is fine. There&rsquo;s no problem at all.&rdquo; So we really didn&rsquo;t know where to go.  Then that cardiologist said, &ldquo;Go back to the lung doctor.&rdquo; </p>
So  in the meantime, my husband is getting weaker and weaker. He stopped eating.  All he could do was try to breathe. That&rsquo;s all he could do. That&rsquo;s all he would want to do. And he just would  hang his head down and try to sleep from sitting up. And finally, an aunt of  Dave&rsquo;s hadn&rsquo;t seen him for a while, she came over and saw  him and she said to me, &ldquo;Val  he&rsquo;s dying. There&rsquo;s something really, really wrong and he&rsquo;s dying. You need to go and see a doctor and you  need to go quickly, and you need to go to the [clinic].&rdquo; And I called them [in] June 2006.  They said you&rsquo;d have to wait a while for an appointment, which  was in 4 days. And within 2 days we had a diagnosis. Dave had seen a  neurologist, he&rsquo;d gone for a sleep  study; he&rsquo;d had continuous Bi-Pap  overnight. He slept for the first night. He woke up in the morning and he was  totally a different man. He was very, very hungry and we went home with that  diagnosis, a prescription for a Bi-Pap, and we were told to give it to the  Manitoba government and we did. They were very quick in getting us the Bi-Pap  machine, and from then on, Dave did not have the breathing issues that he had;  he could breathe, he could sleep. He wasn’t on it 24 hours a day, but at the end of his  journey he passed away on Father’s Day June the 17th  2012 and he was on continuous Bi-Pap 24 hours, 24/7.
