		<p>My husband started to have difficulty  dragging a foot. He started to show symptoms in terms of writing; did not know  what it was. So we went the path of going to the doctor, who sent us for further  tests; sent us to a neurologist. One of my horror memories is that the  neurologist diagnosed my husband over the phone. My husband called him and  asked him—now my husband did pressure him—and [the neurologist] said, &ldquo;Well,  you come in and we&rsquo;ll talk about it.&rdquo; But, in the end, he did tell him the  diagnosis of MS over the phone. And because his personality was suggestive, I  saw the deterioration within 5 minutes. He had been on the phone, he had walked  and all of a sudden, he couldn&rsquo;t master things that he had done just a few  minutes ago. So obviously it&rsquo;s a pet peeve of mine that that should never be  done to anybody.</p>
