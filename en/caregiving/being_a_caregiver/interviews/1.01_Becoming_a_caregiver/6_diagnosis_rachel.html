		<p>It started when I was 13. My mom came in  my room and said, sat me down and said, &ldquo;I have something to tell you.&rdquo; She was  actually originally diagnosed with Lou Gehrig&rsquo;s disease—with ALS—so I was told  that she had ALS and that she would probably die within the next few years. And  then I&rsquo;m not sure exactly when they discovered that she didn&rsquo;t have ALS, [but]  she actually had Multiple Sclerosis. And it&rsquo;s never been so happy to hear that  you have MS as opposed to something else.<br />
		  <br />
I don&rsquo;t remember when the second  conversation was, but she told me at some point, &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t have ALS. I have  MS&rdquo;. So, we were obviously quite pleased with that result as opposed [to ALS],  but the year probably—or two years—leading up to her actually coming to me and  telling me that she was falling a lot and having a lot of problems, she&rsquo;d been  going back and forth to the doctors and no one would really listen to her story,  and no one would take what she was saying seriously, and they just sort of  brushed her off and said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re fine, you&rsquo;re fine&rdquo;. But, she knew something  was wrong. So, I think she actually started being quite adamant about looking  into figuring out what it was that was wrong. <br />
<br />
So, she finally figured out she had MS. She  has primary progressive MS, which is the worst kind you can have. So, I think  there was some sense of relief in her knowing what it was that she had. Then, I  think immediately thereafter, she started walking with a cane. Her left leg is  the part of her body that is the most affected, or was at that time the most  affected. So she started walking with a cane immediately, and then I sort of  remember thinking—you know when someone doesn&rsquo;t tell you that you have  something, you kind of just tough up and say &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m fine&rdquo; and you keep going?  And then the minute someone actually tells you what you have you succumb to it  a lot? I remember that sort of being the case. <br />
<br />
It&rsquo;s always just been my mom and I. She&rsquo;s  a single parent so I kind of feel that I&rsquo;ve always been a caretaker in a way because  we both looked after each other a lot. But then after, that she just sort of  slowly progressed, and her leg got worse. She had bouts of vertigo, and I  remember when I was 16, she probably had vertigo for two months because [she] couldn&rsquo;t  really get in and out of bed. I remember one time, our landlord in the  apartment we were living at had to come upstairs and carry her down to the car  so he could take her to the hospital. I was a teenager, so to be honest, I  don&rsquo;t remember a lot. I think I blocked a lot of it out, but I just remember  knowing that I had to be there more.</p>
