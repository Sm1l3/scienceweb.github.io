		<p>From a pretty early age of four and a  half, I&rsquo;ve lived and been surrounded in an environment where family caregiving  is just something that was always normal. So I guess I started as a caregiver  when I was five, and by that I mean the experience of watching family deal with  a severe brain injury was something that has always been around me. When I was  a young lad, I would be sent into my mother&rsquo;s room at the time whenever she was  getting worked up or anxious. Looking back now, I think I understand why, and I  think that&rsquo;s why I say my caregiving days started at that time, because even  though I didn&rsquo;t know it then, what I was doing –or what the thought was—is that  for whatever reason I could calm her down. And so my maternal grandparents  would, like I said, send me into her room whenever she was getting worked up or  anxious and, and for whatever reason it calmed her down. <br />
		  <br />
As the older I got and the more we lived  with the trials and tribulations of her illness, I was actively involved  wherever I could be, because I wanted to be. And even through university, every  opportunity I could get to offer respite to my grandparents, I would.  And really, [it] wasn&rsquo;t until I finished my  education or my first whack of education, that I then became &lsquo;weekend respite&rsquo;,  or &lsquo;vacation respite&rsquo; for—at the time—my grandparents. As they got  progressively older and my mother&rsquo;s condition changed, they were less able to  provide some of the basic ADL support that she needed, whereas I had finished  schooling in therapy. So, I was able to step into that role on a more formal  basis. I guess when my grandfather passed away, that was […] our acute crisis  in our family caregiving set up, because my grandmother couldn&rsquo;t do it on her  own, and my mom&rsquo;s needs were such that we had to have a better plan in place.</p>
