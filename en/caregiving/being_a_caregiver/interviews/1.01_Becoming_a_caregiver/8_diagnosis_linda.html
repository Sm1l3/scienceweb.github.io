		<p>Well, I met my husband 12 years ago. We  went on a blind date. We had met on the internet and, at that time, I was  living in [a city in BC]. He asked me out on a date, so I was going to go out  for supper with him. He drove all the way to take me  out, and he had never mentioned that he had Parkinson&rsquo;s. He walked in my door  with posies and he was going to give me a kiss, but I wouldn&rsquo;t let him. I  noticed there was something odd about him because his head was going like this.  But I wasn&rsquo;t afraid of him, and of course I knew a little bit of karate so I  wasn&rsquo;t too worried, and out we went. </p>
        <p>We went for supper and I can remember  sitting there dying to know what was wrong with him.  And when you&rsquo;re small and your mother says,  &ldquo;Never ask somebody why they are missing that finger,&rdquo; because it&rsquo;s impolite… well,  he was just such a nice person—I was having such a nice meal and he was such a  nice person—I finally got up the guts to ask him, &ldquo;Do you have Parkinson&rsquo;s  disease?&rdquo; Why that ever came out of my mouth I&rsquo;ll never know because I knew  nothing about Parkinson&rsquo;s. I guess it was just a lucky guess. Parkinson&rsquo;s  disease, 12 years ago to me, was just something that you heard that somebody  had; like Alzheimer&rsquo;s or whatever.</p>
        <p>When I asked him if he had Parkinson&rsquo;s he  said, &ldquo;Yes I do&rdquo;. Well, I almost fell through the pavement. I thought, &ldquo;Oh, now  what do I?&rdquo; because I know Parkinson&rsquo;s is really bad.  So, I thought, &ldquo;Now what do I do?&rdquo;, and as we  were walking across the parking lot to his car he says, &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t worry; it  won&rsquo;t kill me and you can&rsquo;t catch it, and I&rsquo;m going to live a long time, and  I&rsquo;ve had it since I&rsquo;ve been 40.&rdquo; And I knew then in my heart that he was the  nicest person in the world that I would ever meet, and he was someone that I  wanted to keep as a friend forever and ever. I knew then at that point.</p>
        <p>Anyway he called me for three days, night  and day, and he wanted me to come out and visit [a village in BC]. I thought,  &ldquo;Oh, all right,&rdquo; so drove all the way out and I came up to this rustic log  cabin and that&rsquo;s where the magic started. I was visiting and he actually got  quite ill, and so I stayed there and took care of him for a few days, still not  knowing anything about Parkinson&rsquo;s disease and what it does to you and no idea  what I was getting into. Then, I got sick and he looked after me for a few  days. Well to make a long story short, I just never went home, and after five  months, we decided that I should give up my apartment in [a city in BC]. </p>
        <p>My cat and I officially moved in and I  began my journey with Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease […] It really didn&rsquo;t dawn on me that  I was going to be a caregiver at first, even though I did know that his  condition was going to get worse. But after the first time he told me he had  Parkinson&rsquo;s in that parking lot, I&rsquo;ve never seen Parkinson&rsquo;s again; what I&rsquo;ve  seen was him, [my husband], not the disease. And to this day, I think that if  he got well I probably wouldn&rsquo;t like him as well. So, what I&rsquo;m trying to say is  I love him just the way he is, and some days I have to give myself a reality  check because to me he&rsquo;s not sick. To  me, I see the person, not the disease.</p>
