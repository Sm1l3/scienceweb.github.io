		<p>When I first started being a caregiver well, I met my husband, Luke, in 2004. We met  online actually, and then kind of courted each other, so to speak, back and  forth in writing for quite a while before we met in person. Actually at that  time—we always make a joke because at that time I had blue hair that I had done  for a fundraiser, and Luke uses a power wheelchair. He has muscular dystrophy.  So we met each other easily when it was time  to meet in person because he just had to look for the girl with the blue hair  and I had to just look for the guy in the power chair, and we found each other  right away. So, and the rest is history. We got married a couple years after  that.<br />
		  <br />
[…] When I was kind of anticipating this,  and thinking about myself as a caregiver, which I&rsquo;m happy to talk about, I  think what it was first was a relationship—Luke and I&rsquo;s relationship and  marriage. Unlike other caregivers, it wasn&rsquo;t something that kind of happened to  me. It wasn&rsquo;t an illness that had happened that I wasn&rsquo;t expecting or what have  you; Luke has had muscular dystrophy since he was born. […] He already had a  lot of caregivers in his life when I met him, and that was kind of already who  he was. But of course, that&rsquo;s not the reason I fell in love with him. It was  just one of the things he brought to the table along with all his other  qualities. <br />
<br />
One thing I noticed right away though in  myself was not wanting to be a caregiver in the relationship, but just to  protect it as I had envisioned any other relationship. And I found myself  saying to people when we were first together, almost explaining away, &ldquo;Well, he  uses a power wheelchair. He has muscular dystrophy. He has this and this and  this need. But I don&rsquo;t do any of that&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s just about us right? &ldquo;He has  caregivers that help him.&rdquo;I was really clear I think—because of my own fears or  my own stigmas that I internalized about being a caregiver or being the one  depended upon—that I was careful to say that it&rsquo;s not about that, which it  wasn&rsquo;t. But then naturally as you get into a relationship, or as I did with  Luke, you kind of just start taking on different caregiving responsibilities.  […] Well one, because I love him, but also because there&rsquo;s a price to pay with  privacy when you have caregivers in your home. So, in order to have the privacy,  it&rsquo;s either &ldquo;do some of the caregiving yourself&rdquo; or &ldquo;you will never have a  private moment again&rdquo;.</p>
