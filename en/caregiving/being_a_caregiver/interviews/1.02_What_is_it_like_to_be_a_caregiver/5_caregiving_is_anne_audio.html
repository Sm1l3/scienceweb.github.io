		<p>There’s such an ugly side to this; it’s just horrific in  the beginning when you see the awfulness and then you see these other people in  the same situation, what they have to live with. It’s kind of coming to terms  with that kind of stuff and saying, “Well, I’ll do the best I can and make him  as comfortable as I can,” and that kind of thing; just treating another human  being like a human being. I mean, I’m not perfect by any means. I get angry at  him and everything else, but I still couldn’t put him in a place and just throw  a human being away. No, not going to do that. So that’s really what’s the  underlying thing.</p>
