		<p>I simply believe in the value of caregiving. I think that  the experience of caregiving broadens people’s minds and their life’s  experience. I mean, I can talk to people and I know they have never been there.  They haven’t done that, because they live life at a slightly untouched level, whereas  caregivers of adults have a different level of awareness, of what happens in  life and death. Somehow […] you look at people at a different level once you’ve  been a caregiver</p>
