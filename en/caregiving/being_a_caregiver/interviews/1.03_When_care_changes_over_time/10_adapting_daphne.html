	  <p>Anyway, dad  had four clots. I think if he was intubated, trached, he probably would have  lived, but what life would that have been for my dad. He couldn’t talk, and I  don’t think my dad would have wanted it. So the night, he did a congested cough,  and nurses know that there’s a death cough and it’s really deep down, but you  really can’t suction it at all. And I thought, “Oh my God Daphne, your dad is  dying.” But he was comfortable; he wasn’t on too much pain killers, no morphine  or anything. And finally I said, “Good-bye dad,” and I said, “I’ll be back  tomorrow.” He said, “Take care, drive home safely,” and all that. “I’m just  tired.” So, we did him up and he was more comfortable and positioned and I  drove home crying and I thought I should have stayed there. But I had my mom at  home too. So, there are no right and wrong answers when it comes to sick or  being an advocate; it’s doing the best you can and God will forgive all the  other little incidents, or your guardian angel will help you or somebody. But  when I got home I didn’t sleep, I phoned my husband at six o’clock in the  morning I said, “I think my dad is dying [name husband], and he did this  congested cough.” And at seven o’clock in the morning we got a call.</p>
	  <p><br />
	    So I went  up, and I drove my mom up, and it took forever to get her going. We have an  interesting relationship our family. Well, my mom didn’t want to see him and  she hadn’t visited him that much either. And if you want to go see your  relative, don’t let any relatives tell you—your mom or dad, grandma—that you’re  not allowed to go see them, because they’ve past away. You need to have closure.  And I went in there and hugged and talked to my dad even though my brother was  there. And he goes, “Do you need help Daphne?” “No, I don’t need help. I need  to be with my dad.” And […] when my […] mother and brother decided to make  funeral arrangements, I wasn’t allowed to go, and eventually my brother said,  “Maybe we should let Daphne go because she’s been so involved with dad.” There  was a game going on there, but anyway, when I went to the funeral home with my mom—another  lesson learned—he said, “Is there anybody coming to see your father?” And they  had chosen the coffin and all that, and she said, “No,” and I put my hand up to  my mom and I said, “Stop right there. You’ve said everything you’re going to  say, right?” And I looked over at the funeral director and I said, “I want to  see my dad in his legion outfit, and I want to say good-bye to him. I don’t  care whoever else doesn’t, but I do.” And my daughter and my husband came down  for the funeral and they came and saw my dad with me.  And my daughter put a note in my dad’s jacket  to look over her in the future, and I brought my dad’s prayer book because he  was Catholic from home, snuck it out, and I put it in his hands with his  rosary. I took a lock of his hair. They’ll do anything in the nursing home or  in the funeral home. [What] you want done they’ll do. I said, “I guess this  seems odd.” And he goes, “No it’s not; you can take anything you want. You can  put a picture, anything, in that casket you want.” </p>
	  <p><br />
	    And he had  a little funeral out in the country, very simple, and the legion came and my  dad wanted to be buried—this is another thing—with veterans. He wanted to be  buried with the British flag. I thought, “Where in hell am I going to find a  British flag at this?” So I phoned my husband. He had a place in [a city in BC]  here that sold flags. I was going to put a little flag on there if I could. He  found a British flag. So I said to the funeral director, I said, “And we made a  shaft of wheat because he was a farmer, to put in front of the coffin.” He said,  “You can’t put it on the Canadian flag.” I didn’t know that. “Nothing on the  Canadian flag.” So, we put it in front. So, what the people did was, after the  legion did their little last call and explained about it all—it’s beautiful—and  have the legion come. A lot of my uncles, all of them, were in the war and none  of them did this. And it’s such a nice last remembrance for the legion to do  the last call and that. And they took the Canadian flag off, the girls, and  then the British flag was flowing on a pole in the wind, and they took it down  and they put it on dad’s coffin, and as the coffin was going down into the  ground he was buried with his British flag, because he flew under the British  flag.</p>
	  <p><br />
	    <strong>That’s a lovely closure for all of  you.</strong></p>
	  <p><br />
	    And I talk  to my dad still. And we still have issues, and I still have my mother who’s  going to be a different kind of issue, but I have learned a hell of a lot from  everyone around me, people in the hospital, people I’ve worked with, people on  the phone, doctor—good and bad. I’ve learned a lot and I have a lot of stories  to tell and people seem to listen. Because I’ve come through a small town’s  hospital, to a nursing home, to another nursing home that finally he only  stayed about three to four months, and that was his final place. </p>
	  <p><br />
	    Now ending,  another thing I could recommend—my dad wanted to go home. My mom said she  couldn’t handle him. Well, I guess if I’d lived there I probably could have  took him home and got 24-hour care. You can do it. But what my dad wanted was  to see his farm.   When we were packing up his things  at the [veterans hospital] after he passed on—because nobody else was going to  do it—that I could have took my dad home with [name caregiver] in a rented van  thing from [veterans hospital], and we could have took him home and wheeled him  around his farm when the grain was growing and maybe made it in the house,  we’re not sure, with a plank. But that’s all he wanted really was to see his  farm. Because I told dad, “You can’t stay there. Mom can’t look after you.” But  that’s not what he meant. And I promised him I would bring him home a different  way. But I’m sure he’s flying up there with his buddies—he’s the last one of  his group—and I bet he’s got a smile on his face and he’s looking down and  saying ,“I got what I wanted.” Yeah.</p>
