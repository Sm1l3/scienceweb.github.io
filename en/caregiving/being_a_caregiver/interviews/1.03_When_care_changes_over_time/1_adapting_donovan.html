		<p>In 1981 approximately, she was diagnosed  with MS. And by &lsquo;88 she had to leave work. The work that she was doing had far  too much stress for anybody, and the stress exacerbated her MS and probably  brought it on more quickly than it would have otherwise come along. So, she had  to leave work in &lsquo;88 and I retired in 1990. We moved out to the coast from [a city  in AB] in 1990. We had a house built for ourselves on [an] island, which is one  of the […] islands. I don&rsquo;t know if you know the geography around here. And we  lived there for 8 years, and in 1994 her disease progressed to the point where  she had to start using a wheelchair. She could still transfer herself from the  wheelchair to chairs and so on, but because of fears of falling she had to start  using a wheelchair. So in that sense, since 1994 I started being a caregiver.<br />
		  <br />
No, you see this has been such a gradual  process for me, from day one starting in before 1994, because we knew she had  it. But up until about 1994, she was able to deal with things. She could walk,  she could cook, she could function. But then, when it got to the point with a  wheelchair that she was unsteady on her feet—getting very unsteady on her feet—and  I was very afraid that she was going fall and hit her head on something and so,  I had to convince her to start using a wheelchair. And you can&rsquo;t push people to  use a wheelchair until they are ready. They have to be ready &ldquo;up here&rdquo;  emotionally to accept that that&rsquo;s where they&rsquo;re at; that&rsquo;s where <em>it&rsquo;s</em> at. </p>
