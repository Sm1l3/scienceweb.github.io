	  <p>With the incontinence again, it was really more of a trial  and error thing for us to be able to cope at home. I could certainly see there  were certain moments along the way that it probably would have been a good time  to reconsider everything we were doing had we not had that resilience. But we  did it. And so now, it’s fast forward to probably the next big crisis, as far  as her immediate care goes, or her care needs goes, [which] would have been the  hip fracture and the mobility, the loss of mobility. </p>
	  <p><br />
	    Because she went being 30 years with a brain injury, but  being able to ambulate, down to all of a sudden losing that ability. And in  those 30 years of being ambulatory, […] the care was fairly arm’s length. And  that was the way that it worked for her. And so, the continuity took a big hit  when the mobility, the loss of mobility occurred, because we now had to be more  hands-on with her. And that’s not—her comfort zone is just not there with that.  So, that was a big point where I think, more than anything, we find ourselves  a) on the one hand thinking, “We’ve chosen this and we’ve made a decision to do  this for her,” and so there’s that somewhat guilt in thinking that we have we  can’t keep doing this…because we made the choice to do this and any other  option would be a real break in the continuity for her. Even though, again, the  incontinence and the loss of mobility are at certain times along the way, as  far as the caregiving journey goes, that would have been a reasonable, I think—most  people would think—would be a reasonable time to break things up. </p>
	  <p><br />
	    Then ultimately outside of that for myself,[…] again  because I’ve been a family caregiver for what I consider most of my life, I’ve  always made—whether it’s schooling or whether it’s work—decisions and choices  that allow me to continue to be a family caregiver. So again, my transition has  been very hands-on in the early years, to now more hands-off day-to-day, and  really recognizing that with a young, growing family myself, my mother—I don’t  think if she had her say—would want me to sacrifice time with my kids that she  didn’t get with her kids, because of her.</p>
