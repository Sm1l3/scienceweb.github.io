		<p>No, once he’s in bed that’s it. I  give him all his medicine when he goes to bed, and that’s it. It’s just in the morning getting up. Like, he gets up, you have to make sure he  gets into his wheelchair okay. He’s getting really unstable there. I’m worried  about that. He’s barely making it into his chair now. It’s really rough. And  he’s really stubborn, so he’s going do that; he knows once that’s up, that’s  his life for him because he doesn’t want to live after that. So, he’s really  fighting it. So yeah, somebody has to make sure that he gets in there, gets in  the bathroom, gets on the toilet and doesn’t fall. And then it takes, after  that, it takes him about three hours every morning to get up and go to the  washroom, and then wash, and then get back to his bed and put his clothes on  and get up. </p>
		<p>Like it’s, I mean, if he gets up at nine, he’s ready at one, right.  That’s how long it takes him every day just to get your basic things done,  right. He’s been that way for a long time, but it’s getting worse because he’s  getting weaker and he’s… So, that I don’t know. I have to look at that. I’m  kind of avoiding it, kind of thing. I don’t know. Because they, the thing is,  with what he had and everything − they all said, “Oh, he’ll only live 15 years,”  and he’s lived 23 years, right. So, I knew he was going to start getting weaker  and everything, but I’m hoping. I don’t want him to go into a home.</p>
