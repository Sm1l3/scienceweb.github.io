	  <p>Another drug he took for a few years was called  Domperidone, and the reason why our neurologist in [a university hospital] put  him on Domperidone was, he said, it would help constipation. Well it never  really worked. I didn’t realize, I wasn’t told at the time that it’s supposed  to help nausea. I didn’t learn that until I started networking more. And then  finding out it’s supposed to help nausea. And I said, “Oh, I just thought it  was supposed to help the constipation thing,” and I really didn’t think it  worked for either. </p>
	  <p><br />
	    But the other thing was, now my husband is 76 years old,  and he was up several times a night peeing, and of course he’s quite disoriented  and I found in the past three years, I’ve had to put a potty chair right beside  our bed with a ceiling pole. And I even bought a Murphy bed for me to sleep on  because I just wasn’t getting any sleep because he was up and down, up and down  all night. And also prone to bladder infection, it would even be worse. And so,  […] my poor husband, he’d just be so pooped out not getting any sleep.</p>
	  <p><br />
	    Anyway, I thought  about things and I thought about things, and I made an appointment with our  pharmacist because you can do that.  And  I asked her to research Domperidone. Now, the way it was explained to me was  Domperidone is supposed to spas your bowel. So, it spases your bowel and moves  things along, so that’s why it’s supposed to help constipation. So I thought, “If  it spases the bowel, then it must spas the bladder, and maybe that’s why he’s  peeing so much.” So sure enough, our pharmacist she says, “Matsonia your hunch was  right; it was spasing his bladder.” So, we’ve been getting some really good  sleeps not being on Domperidone, and I just think it was just a total waste of  money.</p>
