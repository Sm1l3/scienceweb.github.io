		<p>But anyway, after the six weeks or so, we came home and I  think when I came to [a city in Maritimes] I was feeling a bit better because  my doctor was here, and if [the] need arise, I can take him to the hospital. There  we were completely cut off. So slowly, he was recovering and other thing [that]  I have seen [is] they give you more medication. He started like blood pressure  medications—he was taking [medications], but the doses were kind of a small  dose. And then he just started the cholesterol level to reduce, though he never  had high cholesterol. And then the muscle pain started, and we didn’t know  whether this muscle pain is from the surgery or it’s from the medicine. So,  then I start reading all the literature of what the medication he was taking,  and […] they say that well this medicine can cause –Lipitor—could cause muscle  pain. So then I consulted with my doctor friend: I say, “Well can I stop it?” because  we don’t know what to do, whether it’s okay to stop medication or not. So he  said, “Yes sure you can, because he doesn’t have high cholesterol. So, you can  stop for it and see the effect.” So, we stopped and his muscle pains were gone,  but he suffered for almost a month, and that when you get the muscle pain it  reminds you [of] the heart attack situation. So, you feel kind of frightened  again, scared at what is coming. I hope it’s not repeating that stuff. But  finally […] he’s still not taking that medication for the cholesterol level. And  I think within—I would say it took six months—where because he could not drive  and could not do even other things. But slowly, I mean now he’s okay and we have  no problem.</p>
