		<p>That’s always a  bit tough, and that’s another thing we don’t learn anymore. I know that my mom  took care of her mom—my grandmother died at home. And in those days—and she’s  seen a lot of people dying in those days—and it was something that was part of  life. Now it’s not, we don’t want to talk about it; we hide it. If you go to a  funeral parlour you don’t see, you don’t know anything anymore. I think, just  maybe knowing that perhaps I will be there…until there, so that I don’t panic,  I would like to have more [of] what to look for. How do I know? It’s okay, but  how do I know? How do I not panic [about] the person that I’m looking after? How  do I make it easier? And I know you know. It’s like when my mom got sick, I  went to see her at the hospital and she was supposed to come out, and I said,  “No, she’s not coming out.” But, I worry about that sometimes. Be prepared too.  Like, you have to talk; you have to know your finances. You have to know what  the person wants, without just living in the future. You still have to have  your basics, so that when you’re in that state, that’s taken care of. You don’t  have to waste energy on that. You can focus on something else. That has changed  my perception, and yeah, I do wish it wasn’t such a big mystery, because it is  part of life. And maybe it was more part of life we wouldn’t be freaking out as  much as we are now. And I don’t know.</p>
