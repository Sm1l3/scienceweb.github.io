		<p>For caregivers, I think, one of the best things that  happened for me was when my brother came up for two weeks, and my husband and I  went on a holiday, and my brother and his wife came up and stayed with my  mother for two weeks. And it was wonderful, because I was comfortable leaving  her. And I think that if they could do that more often, and just not expect me  to even be here, and just for me to go away for a week, that would be  wonderful. We, my husband and I, were able to do that once—go away without  worrying about her. Even though, other times we have gone, but we’ve relied on my  daughter or my sister-in-law, my husband’s wife, and her husband—my husband’s  wife…I’m my husband’s wife—my husband’s sister and her husband to take care of  my mother.<br />
		  <br />
        So that’s really putting a lot of responsibility on them.  And then, I’m still calling every night to see how she’s doing, or face timing  them. Thank goodness we have the means to do that. Or they would bring my mom  over to my sister-in-law’s house for supper and we could face time. So, that is a real bonus for us.</p>
