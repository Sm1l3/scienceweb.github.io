Because now, “My God, I have no  choice, I have to get someone. I cannot leave you on the floor.” Which means  that you have to bother a neighbor, and then you... If we had a budget for  this, then you feel less embarrassed. Like when I leave to go to my courses or  at conferences and he is paid, although he is not paid very much, then I feel  more... I think to myself, “At least he is paid to be here.” He would probably  do it voluntarily, but it's me who feels embarrassed. I am not the only one who  feels that way. Some people never asked anything to anybody, and then, they  have to! They do not have a choice but to ask. You don't feel good about this.  You depreciate yourself and you think “Why are there so many people, elderly people  who follow one another.”</p>
