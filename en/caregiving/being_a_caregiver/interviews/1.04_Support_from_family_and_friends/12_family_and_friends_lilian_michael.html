	  <p>And similarly, for us to have a social life it really  means inviting people here because it’s easier for us to do that than to try to  find care in the evening and all that sort of stuff. But part of the learning  is to—so we often will do the meals and so forth, and our friends might say, “Well,  why don’t we, why don’t we just bring the meal?” “No, no, no. It’s okay.” Well,  now it’s like, “Okay.” So Christmas dinner, friends are bringing a turkey and putting  it in the oven early in the day and then coming back and having dinner with us.  And I think that that’s an important part of it too. You can still have a life  and your friends want to be supportive, and I think we sometimes, I think our friends  feel like, “God, stop doing this for us, because every time I come over here,  you provide the meal, you do this and you do that.” And so, I think we’re learning  to say, “Okay, come on over and bring the meal.” Happy to do that. You want to  entertain us? Do it. But entertain us here so that we can meet Ollie’s needs and  do those sorts of things. And that’s been pretty cool. So, this holiday we’ve  just been on, the friends that we went with, they made almost all the meals.  And it was a way for them to take care of us. And learning to step back a bit  and just accepting that, is I think a bit of a trick—certainly for folks like  us, it’s a bit of a trick.</p>
