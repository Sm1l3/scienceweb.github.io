		<p>The support from my husband’s side of the family, in my  opinion, was very poor. My husband comes from a large family. There are eleven  children in the family. There’s a couple of them that are great because they’ve  had their own experiences with illnesses. The rest are oblivious to what this  illness involves and that type of thing. His parents are both deceased. His  father passed away when the illness, I think, was only a year or 2 old. So, his  mother was elderly, but she was a caregiver because she had a mentally  challenged child. So, she was wrapped up. Her support was concern for a son  kind of thing. My family’s side was probably a little bit more understanding. My  father had an illness and my mother had to deal with that for a long time. So,  she was always concerned and she understood when I needed to get a break, get  away kind of thing. She understood that. My sister is supportive, as she’ll  invite me if it’s something that my husband wouldn’t go to because of heat or  whatever. She will still invite me. She will offer it to me, and even though  she and her husband could be going to this or whatever. It could be couples  going to it, but she will still give me the option of saying “Yes, I want to  come along” or “I don’t want to come along”, which I appreciate so much because,  often, couples won’t invite us if they know that my husband can’t go.</p>
