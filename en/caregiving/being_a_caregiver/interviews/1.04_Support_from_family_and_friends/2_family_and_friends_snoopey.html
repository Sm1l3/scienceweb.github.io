		<p>On my dad’s side, he’s not in the picture. He wanted  nothing to do with me throughout my life up till I was three years. And then he  got remarried, and then he had something to do with me. He wanted a boy. He was  there for the labour, and then after the birth, and then after he found out  that it was a girl, he took off. That was it. He didn’t take care of me  whatsoever.<br />
		  <br />
		  <strong>So you’ve been on  your own with your mum since you were three?</strong><br />
		  <br />
		  Yes<br />
		  <br />
		  <strong>That’s hard. So  what about friends and neighbours, anybody else understand your situation?</strong><br />
	    I have a neighbour; she’s actually on holiday right now. She  understands and she helps out a bit. And my friends don’t really understand.  They think, “Oh you know, you care for your mom,” but they don’t understand the  whole situation. </p>
