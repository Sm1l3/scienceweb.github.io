		<p>I feel like through most of it, we never got much support  from anybody. Not family. The family disappeared. Everybody was there in the  very beginning, and then the family just disappeared. And I mean, he has a  brother who lived ten minutes away from us. He visited us maybe once a year. I  haven’t seen them in, I don’t know, five years now. He has one brother who  didn’t visit him either, but eventually now that he’s older, he starts to visit  him every couple of months maybe. So, he was kind of isolated, everybody kind  of drifted away and didn’t bother with him. And I’m  at work all day, so he’s alone a lot of the time too, so it’s a hard part for  him too.<br />
		  <br />
I was really shocked that his family disappeared. His  brothers, I thought they would be there for him, but they weren’t there for  him. Even my family, I mean, they tried to support me, but nobody ever offered  to come and stay with him so I could go out. Nobody, nobody wanted anything to  do with it really. I guess because it was a horrible situation and they want to  pretend it’s not there. But no, it hasn’t been a positive [experience]. Some  people might think they have a positive experience, but I didn’t have a  positive experience at all.</p>

        <p><strong>Have you ever asked for help to these  friends or family or have you?</strong><br />
          <br />
          He has a really  nice cousin. He actually came twice. But when you ask people—like even with him—I  felt like I was inconveniencing him. Like, “Yeah, okay. I’ll do it,” kind of  thing. Nobody said, “Yeah sure. We’ll help out. We’ll give you a break.”  Nobody’s ever done that. Never ever, nobody. So, I don’t have that kind of  support. </p>
