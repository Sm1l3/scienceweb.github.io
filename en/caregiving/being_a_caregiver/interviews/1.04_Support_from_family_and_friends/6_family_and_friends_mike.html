		<p>When you’re diagnosed with MS, one of the first things  they tell you in some of the meetings is that you’ll find out who your friends  are real fast, because it’s such a long term, and then they start reading about  it. And you’ll find out who your true family is real fast.  Oh yeah, right. Judy has a very strong family.  She comes from a family of nine and I come from a family of six, and I can’t  say they’re like scalded rats running off a ship, but it took a time— I was  very surprised over one in particular, and some of the other ones just  basically don’t have a lot to do with her. And she said, “I don’t need this in  my life. I’ve got my family. I’ve got my own friends, and that’s it. If they  don’t want to deal with me, that’s fine.” <br />
		  <br />
Now, we were to her mother’s 95th birthday this  July—not July, May—and the family was all together; it was no problems or  anything, but they don’t communicate with her. And that’s what I find really  hard to take. But I feel sorry for her because they were a close family. And  that’s not uncommon with the disease of MS because of all the ramifications. I  mean, there’s some people that are dead within a year, and other people who live  for 25 years and you’d never know they have MS. <br />
<br />
And when they… and I guess it’s the way it goes with  Alzheimer’s; you start with dementia. Most people start sliding away as they’re  not comfortable with it. I am certainly not comfortable with it. I mean, I’ve  dealt with it in my mother, and I had to because that was it—both my sister and  I. And so, I got into that role and worked with it. I’m still a little antsy  around people that have dementia problems. I can’t say that I run from them,  but it’s difficult at times when I see family that tend to walk away.<br />
<br />
But, and to be fair too, you don’t know what’s going on in  their mind. How are they accepting this? Why are they doing what they’re doing?  Are they afraid that they might get it because it does  run in  families? They don’t find that, but when you lose a brother to it, and then  your sister gets it, and your mother possibly might have had it as part of  the—I mean if you saw my mother walk in here today on her own, you wouldn’t  know there was anything wrong with her. So, is that sitting in the back of  their mind? Do they put it away; they don’t want to deal with it? And outside  of that, family wise, that’s basically it. Other than our children—we have  support from them—but outside of that, not a whole lot of support from others.</p>
