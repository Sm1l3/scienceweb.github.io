		<p>I mean, if I’m brutally honest and I said this to my  friend the other day who I can say these things to—and I’m not sure if you  want, you’re going to want to put this in your interview—I said “You know, if  I’d known 5 years ago what was going happen, I might have walked away from the  relationship.” Because it’s, well a) you don’t have a relationship; you have a  sick person and someone looking after them. And maybe some other people manage  to get around that. I haven’t really figured out how to get around that,  because I so dislike the whole care-giving thing. And I think in some ways my  husband hasn’t figured out how to get around that either because he knows that  I’m not happy doing this. I mean I try and do it; I don’t complain. And  somebody said to me the other day “Well you never complain about this,” and I’m  going “Well what’s the point, there’s no point in complaining. It’s just what I  have to do. I mean, no choices here.” So, not much point in complaining, not  going to change anything. But I’m sure my husband would tell you there are  times—like I don’t do it willingly; I do it because I have to. And I don’t, I’m  not really that happy admitting that. I mean, it’s true but I’d like to be  doing it because it’s so much fun, or it brings you closer or…No, I mean, I  don’t think that’s true. It’s  not true for me anyway.</p>
