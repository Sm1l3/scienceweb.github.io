		<p>But I think  with me, it’s the kind of person I am, I couldn’t put him in a home. I could  not live with myself to know he’s in a home, because my mother was in a home. And  we had taken her to a couple of homes—she had Alzheimer’s so we had to put her  in a home—and some of those homes are hell holes. Just I was disgusted and  after seeing those places. I could not as a human being put another human being  in a place that’s like that. I just couldn’t. I couldn’t live with myself not  knowing how they’re treating them, if they’re making sure they’re clean. Like I  saw some pretty ugly stuff when my mom had Alzheimer’s, and I couldn’t do that  to another person. And I think that’s so shameful that we have places like  that, that they’re putting old people in. They know that now. They’ve seen  people abused in these places. They know all of this stuff. They just want to  close their eyes to it. So I think we’ve got a long way to  go to looking after people that have problems or disabilities or old, are older.<br />
		  <br />
A part of  it is dealing with—like there’s such an ugly side to this; it’s just horrific.  In the beginning when you see the awfulness and then you see these other people  in the same situation, what they have to live with. it’s kind of coming to  terms with that kind of stuff and saying “Well, I’ll do the best I can and make  him as comfortable as I can,” and that kind of thing. Just treating another  human being like a human being. I mean, I’m not perfect by any means. I get  angry at him and everything else, but I still couldn’t put him in a place and  just throw a human being away. No, not going to do that. So that’s really what  is the underlying thing.</p>
