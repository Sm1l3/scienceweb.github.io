So,  when she made a request, I tried to respond as much as possible, and thenâ€¦ But  there were requests that weighed me down, or that I found heavy, that I had  difficulty to respond to, or I was like reacting to, but with my view of things,  it was to allow, as much as possible, to experience pleasant things.</p>
