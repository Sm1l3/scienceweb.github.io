I have a problem with my spine. So I put my two feet  before his feet, I put my hands on his knees, and then I tell him, “Lift you  bum”. Then I push him a little. I move forward a little until he is lower than  his bum in the bed. Then I take one leg and I put it in the bed. I take the  other and I put it in the bed and then I tell him, “Push your bum”. Then I push  on his pelvis so he would be in a normal position. Hence, I have done this  three times during the same week. Therefore I told myself, “What will happen  the next time?” Now he doesn't know how to get out of bed anymore.</p>
