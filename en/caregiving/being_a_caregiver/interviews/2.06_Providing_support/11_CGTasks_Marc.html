	  <p>A few  months ago there was a difficult 2-month period during which he had to make a  decision. But to make that decision, we had to consult with three plastic  surgeons and radiotherapy surgeons. He had to have a scan, x-rays and an MRI  and then, after the three specialists had a teleconference, he had to return to  each of them, with the insecurity and a... how should I say? And a build up to  the point “I made my decision”, it comes a time where I have to make my  decision. Now this is a period, the most difficult period is not knowing where  we are going. What will it imply for the sickness? Also, how am I going to  manage this? Will I still be able to eat by the mouth? Will I have to be  intubated and eat through a PEG? For me, it is the energy level involved in a  healthcare system where the staff changes every eight hours, where the staff  changes during the week-end. All the efforts I put in communicating on behalf  of my friend, to be understood. The tricks for... just a sheet of paper to put  besides his bed. Yes is when he looks down, no is when he looks up.

Then you have to alert  the receptionist and tell her, “Well, he doesn't talk. If you hear his bell, do  not ask him what he wants. He will not answer back.” So it is many small  details like these that cause... Well, you go through the network. Well this is  it, when you don't know in which hospital, and then in the other hospital, and  again in the other hospital, you end up in ethics also, at the CLSC, are we  going?</p>
