		<p>Well my  caregiving task is not a typical caregiving task. I mean, he can still function  with getting things ready. My thing is being a calendar, a memory bank for him  right now. […] Most of my caregiving is reminding him of things, keeping track  of things, like when the kids were little. You have this going on on this day.  I make sure he doesn’t miss an appointment. He still has a bit of meds.  He’s still really good about looking after  that. I don’t have to worry about that. It’s dealing with issues, but he’s  fortunately able to deal with most of the stuff. I need to go along with  appointments and things because I need to hear things, because he forgets things;  he doesn’t process things. So I’m basically his memory bank, his calendar. That’s  the biggest part of caregiving for him I would say. Physically, I don’t need to  do anything physically for his needs. He can still look after what he needs to  do physically. In regard to his caregiving and things, I don’t. I’m not doing  any bathing or any of those kind of things. So, that’s  basically what I am.</p>
