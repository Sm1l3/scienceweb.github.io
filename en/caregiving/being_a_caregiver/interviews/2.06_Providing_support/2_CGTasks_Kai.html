	  <p>It started  about early 2005 when he did his dialysis, and so he was home and he did it at  night for about 8 hours, but with that meant all the supplies that he would  have at the hospital were coming to us now. So about 6-8 weeks, there would be  about 60-70 boxes of medical supplies and at the time we were living in a  2-storey house. The closets weren’t that big, so we could only fit as much as  we could. So a box of solution, of dialysis solution, was about 5-10 lbs each,  and he would use about 4-5 boxes of that. So 4-5 boxes were brought up from  downstairs every single day and he wasn’t at the point where he was forgetting  so I didn’t really need to help him out with different cords hook up to this  and buttons and things like that. But both my mom and I were trained for a  week, basic training on how to hook him up just in case it came to the point  where we needed to help him. More or less, my job was just carting up all of  the medical supplies and I would keep an eye on him for his medication just in  case, making sure he didn’t double dose which sometimes he would do—not  knowingly—and just keeping him motivated, and doing that very subtly because, just  trying to imagine what life’s like in his shoes—he’s forced to medically retire,  he has nothing really to do around the house when we’re not there— so just  trying to like, “You can,” he still had the ability to drive,  “you can go and do that,” and never really  telling him “this” is what he needs to do, because I didn’t want to be  judgemental, that I still have the opportunity to do things while you don’t. </p>
