		<p>And [homecare is] an absolute Godsend. If you have to  speak to any caregivers who do not have homecare and have to look after things  like, like dealing with incontinence issues, or bathing their spouse, or even  trying to get them in and out of things. I mean, 2 years ago I injured my back  because I was helping him. He was at the point where he could still just barely  transfer out of his chair into another chair or into the car, something like  that, even on and off the toilet because he was still using the toilet on his  own then. And initially it was just a kind of a little help and it got to the  point where it was, I was really having to try and lift him and that's when I  injured my back. And I simply said "I'm not doing that anymore." Any kind of  transferring is going to have to be with homecare people, and otherwise, I'm  just not doing it because it's taken 2 Â½ years for my back to start to feel as  if it's somewhat better, not back to where it was. And it is just such a risk  to caregivers because you really do keep doing things until you injure  yourself. <br />
	    <br />
      I remember one of the last times I tried to help him was  he needed to get off the toilet and he just couldn't, he couldn't stand. And so,  I was helping as usual, but at one point he said "I keep telling you! I keep  telling you! You've got to lift me." Well he's 185-190 lbs. How am I supposed  to lift a 185-190 lb man who can't help, right? You're trying to lift that kind  of dead weight, and it never crossed his mind that this was an unreasonable  request to make. </p>
