Just the  managing of all the appointments and the doctors and the follow-ups, and there’s  a lot. It just it takes a lot of time and none of those things alone in and of  themselves are so difficult; it’s not so difficult to help someone dry your  toes after a shower, it’s not the end of the world but it’s the accumulation of  all those things. And there’s always ‘got to be on,’ ‘got to do this,’ ‘got to  do that,’ and  it’s like I feel guilty  for being annoyed sometimes because I know she can’t open a jar. She’s just  called me, she’s having difficulty with that, she’s asking me to help with  that. All these little things, they’re all reasonable but it’s an accumulation  of stuff I have to do and take care of all the time.</p>
