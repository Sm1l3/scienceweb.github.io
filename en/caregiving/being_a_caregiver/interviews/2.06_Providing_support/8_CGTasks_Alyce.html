	  <p>I’ve had, I had a nurse come in one time when Bill cracked  his spine, sorry his neck. He wore a collar and couldn’t do very much—we had to  buy him extra large shirts because they had to go over. He needed a shave  because the beard would irritate his chin, so I had one guy shave him. I had a  nurse bath him, because of my spine I was afraid what if he fell on me then I’d  be useless to him. He had a potty chair at the time and he had a chair for the  shower. We had taken—because it was a different couch—we took a couch and we  even put a coffee table beside him and made sure he was snug for 2 weeks. Actually  it was more than 2 weeks sorry.  I slept  on the floor beside him for 2 weeks, but he lasted on the couch for about a  month. He was not allowed to climb stairs. He was not able to do much on his  own at all, and so that’s how he got his mechanical chair and the first time he  got stuck. </p>
