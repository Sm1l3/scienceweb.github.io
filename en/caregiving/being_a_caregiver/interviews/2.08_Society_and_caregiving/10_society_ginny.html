	  <p>I think, yes.  I think it’s to really look on the positive side and do something positive  every day for others. I just so appreciate when somebody does something for  someone else, whether it was my mother or whether I saw somebody doing  something kind for somebody else in the care centre. There’s nothing, I think,  that is nicer than seeing somebody who needs help get that help and be more  comfortable and happy. Making a person smile, there’s nothing more pleasant  than that. <br />

      I thought I  would find this very difficult, and some questions I did find very difficult  talking about. But I think I’ve shared a lot. I feel that I’ve covered almost  all of the points that I think… My mother is one of the lucky ones, I think. She  has family; she has me. But when I look around at some of the places, there are  people who don’t have anyone. I think if there’s something that we can do to  brighten someone’s day who doesn’t have anyone, I think that would be something  that would be important. And I know how much these people love the people who  work here. They become like a family and the person-to-person contact is just  so important. I think those people who don’t have anyone deserve to have  somebody come and visit them, or bring them a flower, even just talk to them in  the hallway. And I know I try to do that, and I know that my daughter tries to  do that.  If somebody looks like they  need a little bit of help, we’ll offer. And that’s one thing that I never would  have thought before. I never would have thought to offer my time in a nursing  home. But I certainly will now. And even when mom passes, I hope that I would  find that little bit of time to do something for others.</p>
