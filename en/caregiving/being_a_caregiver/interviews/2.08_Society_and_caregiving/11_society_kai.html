	  <p>We are getting the word out there, but our goal is to  challenge legislation and to get the support. And if they can’t afford to give  us support, at least give the children the recognition that they want. Because  they feel that, a lot of them, the common thing that we get is “We feel that  they favour the adults more than the youth,” because they feel that the youth  have the energy, they have the—they’re young; they’ve assumed that we have the  time to do this. But to juggle between the family, education, social life... <br />
	    <br />
	    Social life is the big thing. I think that’s one of the  things that I do wish that…because of this experience I missed out on a lot. Not  much of my high school career, but my early 20s was basically looking after  dad. So I missed out on a lot of those experiences<strong> </strong><br />
	    <br />
      It’s hard work.  But  there’s good times and bad times, but I think there’s more of a sacrifice on  the youth caregivers’ part. They’re sacrificing their education, their social  life.  And that’s the thing. I think the  government needs to know that social life is, I think, the most—well I have to say—the  most important part of a kid’s life, because that’s what helps us to learn how  to be around people and society, and to work together. And I think if we, if  the experience isn’t there, […] it’s really hard to regain that, that sense of  social life. Like I said, I’m still struggling to fit in with my friends. And  they know what I went through now, but even still, it’s still difficult. So, I think  there’s more of a sacrifice for the youth because we don’t have the support  from the government. We still feel that they just don’t…they see it as a way of  life for us and it’s expected of us because we’re young. But I think it’s more  of a sacrifice for youth.</p>
