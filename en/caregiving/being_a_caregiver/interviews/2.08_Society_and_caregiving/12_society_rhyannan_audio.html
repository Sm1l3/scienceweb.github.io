          <p>I know that there are people out there who are the only  person doing the caregiving for someone who is seriously chronically ill or  dying. But it’s a hell of a lot to handle as well as your own life, and  especially, I think, when dementia’s involved. Because you’re constantly having  to try and move through the confusion and the contradictions and try and figure  out what it is that they really want and whether it’s possible to give it to  them. And so, I don’t know. I mean, I don’t know how in the culture we can  support people—who don’t necessarily know each other, but who are friends of  the person that needs the caregiving—to come together and work as a group. And  perhaps, that would be facilitated through these specific roles of power of  attorney and representative. I mean, those people end up having to work  together. But I guess, I would really encourage people to, if at all possible,  have that circle of friends from the person who you are caregiving for, because  there’s going to be so much that one of them will know that the others won’t  know.</p>
