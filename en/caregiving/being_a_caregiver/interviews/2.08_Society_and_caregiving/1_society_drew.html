	  <p>We feel like, as family, we feel like we are contributing  to the public health system in a very material way, if nothing else. And yet,  that’s not always how we’re received. So, if it’s a little extra, I don’t know,  recognition around something like holding a cigarette, or whether it’s a little  extra support in terms of accessing respite, accessing support groups,  accessing really anybody with practical, hands-on experience, we feel that we  should be able to do that because, again, for us, if nothing else, we have, by  making a decision to keep her at home, we are materially saving the wider  public purse quite significantly. And that, I think, is worthy of a little bit  of leeway as far as accessing the assistance when we do need it, because we  don’t do it that often. All things considered, that time that she was in the  hospital—that would have been 3 years ago—that was the first time she had been  to a hospital in 20 years. So  we must be doing something right, right? </p>
