          <p>I don’t see  a whole lot of information out there that I recognize as someone who’s younger,  still working, that kind of thing. It’s just not out there. It’s not, that’s  not seen as ‘maybe there’s not that many people in that role’ but there is;  I’ve run into people through doing, being a caregiver,  I’ve run into a fair number of people,  probably in my age group or younger, who are caregiving spouses. So, I mean,  but it doesn’t seem to be high on the radar. And any programs I’ve heard of  from the federal government seem to be for older caregivers and family  caregiving for older relatives—parents. I don’t see anything else out there. There  needs to be something about…there needs to be some support for people who work.  I mean, I know people that just leave their jobs; they don’t have a choice. I  mean, I have a choice because I work for an employer—well, I’m unionized so, I  mean, I have some rights and benefits and stuff that other people don’t have  […]. So in many ways, I consider myself fortunate because I’ve got these things  a lot of other people don’t have. They just have to abandon their jobs. I mean,  I work with a lot of people on disability—persons with disabilities under the  provincial government—and, I mean, a lot of those people are in that situation  because they’ve had health issues and they didn’t have any other choice. And  now they live on $901 a month. I mean, I’m very grateful for what we’ve got.  […] I would just think it’s really deplorable there’s no support out there for  the people.</p>
