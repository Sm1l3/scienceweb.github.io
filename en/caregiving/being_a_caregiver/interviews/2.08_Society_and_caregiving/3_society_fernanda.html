	  <p>You asked me of my frustration—what was the negative? And  perhaps it’s also very big negative impact was that how many people are so  ignorant about the caregiver’s role. And if more and more people can become  educated…everybody feels it’s always about this person [who has] got cancer and  is dying, and the thing about being a caregiver is that I am now not just… when  I hear that, I turn to the other person—to the wife, or to the husband—and say  “And how are you doing?” And you know what? A lot of them burst into tears  because no one’s ever asked them that. So if there can be more of an awareness  of what it is that caregivers go out there…what they go through, what they  experience. If they can be heard, if there can be somebody to take the time to  hear what they go through and the toughness it is for them, perhaps this will…perhaps  it gives caregivers…it can give a caregiver the thing of “I’m not there alone”.  And so, even though today’s a really bad day, it’s okay. Like, I can make it  through that day; I’ve just got to do it one minute at a time, one hour at a  time. Just like everybody else, we all want to be heard.</p>
