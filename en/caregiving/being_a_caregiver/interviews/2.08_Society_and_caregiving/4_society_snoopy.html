	  <p>A lot of people look at me and my mom and they think “Oh,  she’s obese because she doesn’t get out much,” and “there’s something wrong  with her.” But it’s not her fault. She can’t walk. I mean, she goes like maybe  15 feet to the bathroom and she’s already huffing and puffing when she comes  back, and so. <br />
	    <br />
      If they see me on the street and I’m picking up pop tins,  it’s not because I want to; it’s because I need the extra cash. I get harassed  by teenagers for doing so. Normally, I just wear sweatpants, baggy sweatpants, and  my top here, and they say “Oh, you don’t have nice clothing. You should wear  nice clothing.” Well, I don’t have the money for that. And what’s the point of  going out when you’re just going to the store and wear something nice and it  gets dirty or stained. And if you see me on the street, just smile and wave. Don’t  harass me, and come after me because I’m pulling a cart behind me.</p>
