		<p>Okay so let me speak a bit about the isolation of the  caregiver, okay. So, my first incident was when my children were very young and  my husband stopped driving and I came to pick him up at the local Y. I had two  children in car seats in the backseat that had fallen asleep, I was sitting in  the car and my husband came out and started to walk down the stairs to the car.  And I knew instinctively, it was very early in the illness, but something told  me, “Don’t help him; he needs to be as independent as he can.” I saw that it  wasn’t a safety issue, so I let him handle the stairs but I found it so  difficult that I held onto the steering wheel so tight that I didn’t even  realize until later that my palms were bleeding, that my nails had cut into my  palms. And as I was watching him in the rear-view mirror to make sure he was  okay, a friend rounded the corner, looked at me in the car, looked at my  husband on the stairs, walked over to the car and said, “You bitch,” and ran to  help him. And that was the beginning of my awareness of exactly how the  caregiver is perceived when they don’t do what is considered normative. But in  a chronic illness, you cannot do what’s normative. It’s not a crisis illness  that’s going to go away in 6 months; this is the rest of your life and this is  the rest of your family’s life, and you have to handle it in a way that makes  sense for your family. And if you expect your relatives who are not around,  your friends or strangers to understand, you’re going to be very, very  disappointed. Most people have  no idea what’s involved.</p>
        <p>anybody.</p>
