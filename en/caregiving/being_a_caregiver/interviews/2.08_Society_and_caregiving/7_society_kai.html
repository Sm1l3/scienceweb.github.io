	  <p>So moving forward, probably about the summer of 2007, I  was at a point where I needed a job. So I got a job doing barista—I was a  barista—and I also got a job as sales worker, retail. And it was good. It got  me out of the house and it allowed me to have a little financial security. And  it was very interesting, at this conference I just attended, how most youth  caregivers suffer from presentism. Like, you’re present at work, but my mind  was never really at work. I remember, like, I got a lot of flack at my retail  store because I might have overcharged someone or did something wrong on the  computer. And I apologized for it, but I knew I didn’t want to say it, but I  knew that was because in my   mind, I was  probably thinking about what’s going on with dad because he was by himself. My  mom was at work and so it was difficult. Like, I enjoyed the fact that I was  out, I was doing something productive other than cleaning toilets, but I know  that work definitely suffered because of the fact that I was thinking about my  dad. And not that it was a bad thing. I think if I would have told my employers,  I probably would have gotten a little bit, you know, some slack in that term. But  it’s like the documentary says: it’s definitely a stigma. You don’t want to  tell the world that your family isn’t perfect.[…] You want them to think that  you have a perfect family, there’s nothing wrong. But it came to the point  where work was really suffering, and I was eventually fired.</p>
