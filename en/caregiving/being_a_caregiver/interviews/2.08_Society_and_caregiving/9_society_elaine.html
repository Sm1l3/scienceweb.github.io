	  <p>Oh, just for awareness. I think the more we talk about our  lives, the more it can enlighten others: “Okay, I’m not so alone.” I’ve heard  that from our Parkinson people that come to our group, new people: “I thought I  was the only one in [city in ON] with Parkinson’s.” They’re overwhelmed with  gratitude that they find that we’ve got a little community here where we’re  doing our best to help people understand it, and awareness of the disease. And  the more it’s talked about, more people get aware of it, the better it will be. <br />
	    <br />
      So my primary focus of course is spreading awareness about  Parkinson’s, and I do that in the simplest ways. My husband can walk a little  bit, so he’ll get out of the car and he’s walking into a restaurant or in a  clinic where he’s had to leave his scooter in the hall, and he’s walking  through the door and he freezes, can’t walk any farther. His body, his brain  just shuts down and he’s stuck in the door and he has to give himself time for  the neurons to get going—whatever it is, I don’t even know. You’d think I’d  know that, but I don’t—for the dopamine to work and for him to be able to move  through that door. I take that time to have a little mini workshop on  Parkinson’s. And no matter who’s sitting in the waiting room, I’ll just say “Ladies  and gentlemen, you’re looking at Parkinson’s disease,” and that, you’d be  amazed what happens. A bunch of grouchy people sitting in a clinic, nobody’s  saying a word to anybody, and all of a sudden “My grandfather had that.” And “Oh,  my uncle has that.” And now we’re all talking about Parkinson’s disease instead  of everybody sort of not wanting to look at my husband, making it more  stressful for him. I’ve lightened up the room, and then he’s able to cope with  getting through. And very often he’ll get even clapped: “You made it through  the door!” And you lighten it up and say “Yeah, we’re coping with this.” We are coping with this in that way.</p>
