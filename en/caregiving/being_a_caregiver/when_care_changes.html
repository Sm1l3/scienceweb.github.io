<h1>When care changes over time</h1>

<p>Most people we interviewed described changes in their  care recipient&rsquo;s  health over time. Few caregivers saw any improvement or stability in their care  recipient&rsquo;s  condition. In general, the care recipients&rsquo; conditions  deteriorated over time. Many caregivers described having to progressively make  adjustments according to their care recipient&rsquo;s changing needs. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Changing needs and capacities  of the care recipient</h2>
<p>Val said, &ldquo;As Dave progressed  and got sicker, he couldn&rsquo;t do anything by himself; he was totally paralysed. I  felt I needed more hours.&rdquo; Elaine noticed her husband&rsquo;s deterioration from  illness as well: &ldquo;Of course there&rsquo;s changes and over the years. I have to do more and more of real caregiving, which  I&rsquo;m in now. But again, I&rsquo;m very fortunate because he&rsquo;s a positive man and so grateful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Caregivers sometimes noticed their loved one was getting worse  because they would fall more often. Christine said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s progressive. In the last two years, she fell at least six times in the house and hit  her head at least four  times. And that hasn&rsquo;t helped her condition. She&rsquo;s starting to lose her memory  a little, and she was not able to walk at all up and down the steps.&rdquo; Joanne  said, &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll do things that aren&rsquo;t safe, which drives me crazy.&rdquo; </p>

<p>Several care recipients were mentally or cognitively affected by their illness. Sometimes this meant that their needs changed as well. Matsonia and Christiane both noticed that their husbands developed dementia  as an effect of the Parkinson's disease. This was a significant moment, because they were no longer able to leave their husbands alone. Christiane said, "Then complications arose because the dementia set in. I could not leave him alone at all because he was smoking."

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Losses over time </h2>
<p>Several caregivers describe the physical deterioration of the care recipient over time. Shayna said, "He had the kind of MS that progressed steadily but slowly. And so, over the 25 years he went from using a cane, to using crutches, to being in a wheelchair." Several caregivers described how they had to deal with gradual losses over time instead of experiencing a single loss. For some caregivers, it was hard to predict what would happen next. Christiane, for example said, "You lose a bit, then a bit more, then a little bit more and more. He gets worse."

</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>For many caregivers, it is difficult to watch the care recipient lose their physical and/or mental capacities. Some caregivers described how the care recipient fought against the symptoms of their illness, and describe how difficult it is to see their loved one suffer. Fernanda said, "It's tough to watch the person you love with all your heart, and you'd do anything for, being in pain 24/7." 
</p>
<p>Sometimes it came to a point where the caregivers decided  that they could no longer take care of their care recipient at home (for more, please  see <a href="../resources_and_professional_services/hospitals_facilities.html">Hospitals and  Facilities</a>).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Medication use </h2>
<p>Several caregivers spoke about side effects from medications. They tried to respond to these problems as fast as they could, sometimes changing medication  in order to prevent certain effects. It is recommended to always check with the health care professionals before making any changes in medication.  
  <br />
  <br />
  For example, Matsonia's husband's symptoms of dementia  become much worse when  he has a bladder infection. So, she tried to find a way to detect a bladder infection on her own, so he can be treated sooner: "So, I went to about three different pharmacies and finally a pharmacy  helped. A pharmacist helped me out and he researched, and he got these little sticks." Now she is able to detect his infections and get treatment much sooner.

<p>Several caregivers spoke about how the caregiving experience seemed to stay with them after their loved one had passed away. Shayna said, "It comes from 25 years of caregiving, my body is always on. I cannot—my husband is gone seven years—I cannot shut off the phone at night. I always have to be available." Kai said, "I keep thinking back, like, I'm still looking after dad: "Oh man, I forgot to turn on the dialysis machine!" I  once or twice I'll catch myself doing that."
  <br />
  <br />
  Some caregivers spoke about the feeling of relief they felt once the care recipient passed away. Shayna said, "I think if you're a long-term caregiver when your spouse passes away, the first thing you will feel is relief. And then, you'll feel guilty for the rest of your life for that relief that you felt."
