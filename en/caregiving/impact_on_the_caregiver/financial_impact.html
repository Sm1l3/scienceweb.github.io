<h1><strong>Financial impact</strong></h1>

<p>Most  caregivers make use of specific resources and support programs that reduce the  financial impact of caregiving, but it is clear that there is a significant  financial burden for individuals and families engaged in caregiving. Currently,  over two million people in Canada are providing care for a family or friend  with an illness or disability. It has been estimated that the economic value of  care that informal caregivers provide in Canada is over $25 billion dollars a  year. The financial contribution of caregivers translates into cost-savings for  the health and social care system, although there are few financial incentives  or mechanisms to support caregivers with the additional costs of providing care  at home. Some provinces in Canada are considering legislation to change this. </p>
<p>The  people that we interviewed were financially affected in many different ways.  Lorna and Inez, for example, both experienced a surprising reduction in  expenses because they were doing less than before. Inez said, &ldquo;Actually the  biggest impact is we don&rsquo;t have to buy gas because we hardly go anywhere.&rdquo;  Most, however, were living with increased personal and home expenses related to  caregiving. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Home  adaptation and medical equipment</h2>
<p>Most  caregivers reported additional expenses related to changes at home, equipment  or treatment that was not covered by public or private insurance plans.&nbsp; Donovan, for example, explained how he had to get a special  cushion fixed for his wife: &ldquo;It finally came back and it cost us $90 for that.  And then within one week, we found that it was still leaking and then we had to  buy a new one.&rdquo; </p>

<p>Caregivers reported additional expenses for medication and hospital visits. Several caregivers described their appreciation for the medical care system in Canada, but Richard explained that, although the medical system is good in Canada, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that there are no extra costs involved for medication. </p>

<p>There are many other costs  that may arise in a care situation. For example, Mrs. Smith&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s care facility was far away,  which created many practical issues. Although  there were public facilities closer by, there was a four-year waiting list for them. So, she and her  husband decided to move her mother to a private  institution nearby. </p>
<p>Richard explained, &ldquo;The  money problem worried me a fair amount because we were spending so much. And  then, we were fortunate that&hellip; at some point, we were just getting ready to go  to Maine for more treatment for Vivienne&rsquo;s lymphedema, but that was going to  cost $10,000 US, and friends were even going to try and raise money for us and  I felt embarrassed. It affected my pride, and I know it&rsquo;s false pride, but you  want to feel that you can manage. And we were saved by the bell. I don&rsquo;t know  how they did it, but the province where we lived is a poor province, and for  many years they did not provide treatment for lymphedema. Finally, just about  when we were deciding whether to go or not to Maine, we learned that they had  just started up a program with a physiotherapist at the hospital.&rdquo; </p>
<p>In Matsonia&rsquo;s case, her  husband&rsquo;s behaviour changed due to medication use and her husband started  spending lots of money: &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t realize Bromocriptine was making him do the  things that he was doing and making him lie to me. And this was very damaging  and also it cost us a lot of money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>David,  who retired early, has recently decided to move to a smaller apartment to  reduce costs. Richard re-mortgaged his house to pay for his wife&rsquo;s medication. Christiane  moved to another apartment to reduce costs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Effects  on the caregivers lives</h2>
<p>Not  having sufficient funds for the care situation can have serious consequences in  peoples&rsquo; lives. Donovan, for example, feels he needs therapy because he is  feeling very depressed lately, but is unable to pay for this service.  Christiane has informed herself about her legal options and mandate in case her  husband&rsquo;s incapacity, but is not able to pay the associated fees; she explained  that her husband can still refuse care despite his mental incapacity. </p>

<p>In some cases, the  caregivers also discovered a way to reduce expenses. H&eacute;l&egrave;ne realised that there  are little things you can do to be more frugal: &ldquo;Another silly thing, Air  Miles. I&rsquo;m  not going travel now maybe, not now. Air Miles you  don&rsquo;t have to travel with them; you can do anything. So I&rsquo;m getting free  magazine subscriptions and that too helped. &lsquo;Okay, I&rsquo;ve got my Chatelaine,&rsquo; or  whatever, &lsquo;free.&rsquo;&rdquo; </p>

<h2>Employment  and paid care</h2>
<p>Many  caregivers organized privately paid caregivers to help with the care in order  to go to work or on holidays. </p>

<p>In  several situations, the family income was reduced because of caregiving. There  were many reasons for reduced income. For example, Shoshana&rsquo;s husband was  forced to change jobs because of his illness and had a reduced income. Shayna  did not advance in her professional life because she would have been unable to  combine her new work responsibilities with her care situation at home. H&eacute;l&egrave;ne  decided to stay home without pay to be able to provide care, and spent her RRSP  savings.
