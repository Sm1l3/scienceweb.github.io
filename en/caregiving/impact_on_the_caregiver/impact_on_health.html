<h1>Impact on health</h1>

<p>In this topic page you can  read about the health impact that caregivers experienced during and after their  caregiving period. For most people,  overall, caregiving seemed to have a negative impact on their physical and  mental health. This varied from minor issues or symptoms to more severe  episodes like being admitted to hospital for stress.</p>
<p>However, there were also some caregivers who did not  notice any significant effects on their own health. Some caregivers described how  it helped them work harder to stay healthy. For example, Anne said, &ldquo;It makes me  exercise more, eat better, try and keep myself healthy because I don&rsquo;t want to  end up like these poor people in these institutions and home.&rdquo; And Jacques said,  &ldquo;Having to care for my daughter prevented me from ageing. It did not force me  to age, it prevented me from ageing. This is the impression that I have.  Because I am caring for her, I don&rsquo;t have time to think that I am getting older  or anything like that. I don&rsquo;t have time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why there is an impact on health</h2>
<p>The caregivers we interviewed  spoke about how caregiving affected their health. For example, they mentioned  things like the heavy workload from managing caregiving and family life, sleep  shortages, feeling overwhelmed, stress, and depression. </p>
<p>Some caregivers experienced burnout at  one time or other. Fernanda  said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty much a classical case  of caregiver burnout. There have been plenty of mornings when I woke up and I  don&rsquo;t know how much longer I can do it for.&rdquo; </p>

<p>Several caregivers also  noticed changes in their own behaviours that may have negatively affected their  health. Some caregivers found that they were  not able to do enough exercise or had developed bad eating habits. Ginny, for  example, said, &ldquo;I gained weight  rather than lost it because I was, I guess, I was eating things that I  shouldn&rsquo;t have been eating just because it was there. And it was mindless  eating often, and I would think to myself, &lsquo;Oh, I deserve this. I&rsquo;ve had a  difficult day,&rsquo; or whatever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some caregivers noticed that they were smoking or  drinking more alcohol than before. Kai spoke about how he smoked to deal with  the stress: &ldquo;And it was really ironic. I&rsquo;m worried about his health but  (for) most youth caregivers, we really don&rsquo;t care about our own health because  we&rsquo;re too busy worrying about whomever we&rsquo;re looking after, and this gets us  through the day.&rdquo; One caregiver described what happens when people try to cope by  using alcohol: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a temporary measure because you wake up and the next  day, and it&rsquo;s still the same old stuff that you&rsquo;re dealing with.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Physical impact</h2>
<p>Several caregivers developed  back, shoulder and neck problems from physical manoeuvres that they frequently  had to perform while assisting their care recipient. </p>

<div class="clear"></div>

<p>Caregivers also suggested that some of  their health problems were related to stress. They described, for example,  increased symptoms of fibromyalgia or polymyalgia, and pain from arthritis and diabetes.  Fernanda described what happened to her after she decided to place her mother  in a nursing home: &ldquo;The day that my mother got in the nursing home was a  Friday. That Monday morning, I could not get up from bed. I could not, but it  was my back. I couldn&rsquo;t, I couldn&rsquo;t walk. So from July until January the next  year I went through x-rays, through physiotherapy, and everything because I  just I could not walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Caregivers mentioned other effects on  their health, including increased blood pressure, high cholesterol, hives,  stomach problems, headaches, ulcers, asthma, and palpitations. It was not  always easy for the caregivers to find time and energy to visit their family  physician in order to work out their own health issues. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Mental health</h2>
<p>Many caregivers spoke about  increased levels of stress, anxiety, depression and burnout. For several  caregivers, these problems had resulted in hospitalization at some point for  stress. Some described having suicidal thoughts. </p>

	<a style="float:left;"><img src="../profile/100x100/18_Marc.jpg" /></a>

<p>Most caregivers spoke about  the stress associated with caregiving. Often their stress level varied over  time and peaked when faced with certain events. For example, having a care recipient  admitted to hospital was often very stressful. On the other hand, when a care  recipient went to a facility or received full-time professional help,  caregivers usually felt relieved. </p>
<p>The caregivers we interviewed  also spoke about other origins of their stress. They said that caregiving was  stressful because &ldquo;anything may happen&rdquo;, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s nerve wracking&rdquo;, or because &ldquo;you have to hyper  vigilant&rdquo;. One caregiver felt that &ldquo;caregiving is a constant worry and there is no more enjoyment.&rdquo; </p>

<h2>Suicidal thoughts</h2>
<p>The stress and burden of caregiving was severe enough for some caregivers to have suicidal thoughts, just so they could escape their situation as a caregiver. </p>
<div class="purpleBox">
	<a style="float:left;"><img src="../profile/100x100/images/00_audio.jpg" /></a>

<p>Christine said, &ldquo;Ask  for help, and look for the help, and demand the help. And if you have that  support from family, friends, CLSC wherever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Professionals advise that if you are experiencing suicidal thoughts,  please contact your local suicide hotline or other resource as soon as  possible. But it the thoughts persist and you are feeling desperate, we urge  you to immediately go to the ER or to call 911. Do not let go, help is close  by. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Professional counselling</h2>
<p>Many caregivers we interviewed had seen professional  counsellors to help them through their most difficult periods. </p>

<p>Several caregivers describe how they had to &ldquo;shop&rdquo; around to  find the right services for them. Sometimes it took awhile to find the right  person with the right approach. Some caregivers were restricted in finding help  because of their limited finances. However, the caregivers who did find help  noticed the positive effects of seeing a healthcare professional who was there  to assist them.</p>
