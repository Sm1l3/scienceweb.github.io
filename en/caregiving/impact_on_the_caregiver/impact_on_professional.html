<h1>Impact on professional life and career</h1>

<p>The  people we interviewed were in all kinds of different stages of their lives and  careers, and caregiving often had a major impact on their working situations  and professional aspirations. In addition, many of the people we interviewed had  been caregivers for more than10 years. During this time, their working  arrangements changed frequently. Several caregivers were not working at the  time of the interview and others had previously lived through periods when they  were unable to work. For many, the demands of caregiving led to changes in  their work situation, including reduced hours, unemployment, sick leave, or  unpaid leave from work.</p>

<p>Almost  half of the caregivers we interviewed were either working full-time or  part-time. Some of the people we spoke to chose to work part-time, in order to combine their work and  caregiving responsibilities. </p>

<p>Almost half of the people we spoke to were retired. Several of these people retired early so as to continue caring for their care recipient. Some also retired because of personal health reasons associated with the burden of  caregiving. </p>

<h2>Young  caregivers</h2>
<p>Some  of the people we interviewed started caregiving before the age of 25. Being a  caregiver at a young age affected their choices in life. For example, Rachel  did not choose the university she would have liked because it was too far away  from home, where she was needed. Snoopey is currently caring for her mother and is not working or at  school. Kai is now living with his sister and cares for her children. He is also  very active in the youth caregiving group in his region. At the time he was  caring for his father, he was fired from his work. </p>

<h2>Time  for care</h2>
<p>It  can be challenging to combine caregiving and work. Fernanda, who has to leave  work early to bring her mother for dialysis treatment, said it is really hard  to leave early from work almost every day, year after year.</p>
<p>When  the phone rang at work, Joseph would always think for a moment that it might be  his wife calling because she needed help.</p>
<div class="purpleBox">
	<a style="float:left;"><img src="../profile/100x100/04_Sheni.jpg" /></a>
	<div class="purpleBoxContainer">
		<div class="purpleBoxContent">
It is difficult to work while caring for someone at home. Sheni dealt with situations that she felt most people never have to deal with.

<p>Some  situations required that the caregivers remain home and take leave from work.  For example, Rowdyneko took a leave to be able to care for her husband at home.  Still she feels conflicted about this decision because, in some ways, her job  was a respite from caregiving. Val had a similar experience and returned back  to her work after a leave of absence. She said, &ldquo;Being with a critically ill  person all day really takes a lot out of you.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Support  from work</h2>
<p>Caregivers  who continued to work experienced different levels of support from their  employers and colleagues. Good support, flexibility, and understanding from  their employers were very important to them.</p>
<div class="purpleBox">

<p>Not everybody felt  supported at work, which added to the stress of their situation. Anne, a  caregiver for her husband, was absent from her work to look after her daughter  who had an accident. She said, &ldquo;They [her employers] were  understanding at first, but then they started implying to me that &lsquo;maybe I  should leave&rsquo; kind of thing. But my daughter had to go stay in this children&rsquo;s  hospital for a while too, and I spent a lot of time there. And when she came  home, there was a lot to do with her too.&rdquo; H&eacute;l&egrave;ne described her colleagues&rsquo;  reaction: &ldquo;The hardest part was, especially with work or colleagues, is &lsquo;It&rsquo;s  not you that&rsquo;s sick; it&rsquo;s him. What&rsquo;s your problem?&rsquo; And every time I would  hear that, I don&rsquo;t know,  I&rsquo;m just as sick in a way because I&rsquo;m very, very close to my husband and it  affects me just the same. But no, not just the same. I will never know. I will  never be in his shoes, but it&rsquo;s just as difficult.&rdquo; </p>

<h2>Effect  on professional life</h2>
<p>In  some cases, the caregivers felt that they already had a natural motivation to  be a caregiver. Drew, for example, became a caregiver when he was still very  young. He said, &ldquo;I continue to work with other family caregivers, and I continue  to work with other seniors, for example, around home and community-based living.  [&hellip;] I guess I&rsquo;m just naturally predisposed somewhat to that role of a  caregiver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other  caregivers became more professionally involved in caregiving issues once they  had lived their caregiving experience. Several caregivers became involved in  their local caregivers&rsquo; support groups. Some caregivers also became active  advocates for caregivers more generally in society.</p>
