		<p>It&rsquo;s just in the morning getting up. Like, he gets up, you have to make sure he gets into his wheelchair okay. He&rsquo;s getting really unstable there. I&rsquo;m worried about that. [&hellip;] He&rsquo;s barely making it  into his chair now, it&rsquo;s really rough. And he&rsquo;s really stubborn, so he&rsquo;s going do that; he knows once that&rsquo;s up, that&rsquo;s his life for him because he doesn&rsquo;t want to live after that. So he&rsquo;s really fighting it. So yeah, somebody has to make sure that he gets in there, gets in the bathroom, gets on the toilet and doesn&rsquo;t fall. And then it takes, after that, it takes him about 3 hours every morning to get up, and go to the washroom, and then wash, and then get back to his bed, and put his clothes on and get up. Like it&rsquo;s, I mean, if he gets up at 9, he&rsquo;s ready at 1, right. That&rsquo;s how long it takes him every day just to get your basic things done, right. He&rsquo;s been that way for a long time, but it&rsquo;s getting worse because he&rsquo;s getting weaker and he&rsquo;s&hellip; so that I don&rsquo;t know. I have to look at that. I&rsquo;m kind of avoiding it, kind of thing. I don&rsquo;t know. Because they&mdash;the thing is, with what he had and everything&mdash;they all said, &ldquo;Oh he&rsquo;ll only live 15 years,&rdquo; and he&rsquo;s lived 23 years, right. So, I knew he was going to  start getting weaker and everything, but I&rsquo;m hoping. I don&rsquo;t want him to go into a home.</p>
        <p>My husband, I don&rsquo;t know, I don&rsquo;t know  what&rsquo;s going to happen when he can&rsquo;t even get out of bed at all. I don&rsquo;t know. He&rsquo;s in a lot of pain, all the time. I don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going to happen. But then, I haven&rsquo;t known for all these years what&rsquo;s going to happen, so [&hellip;] after a while, you just kind of adjust to it, and whatever&rsquo;s going to happen is going to happen. Nothing I can do about it.</p>
