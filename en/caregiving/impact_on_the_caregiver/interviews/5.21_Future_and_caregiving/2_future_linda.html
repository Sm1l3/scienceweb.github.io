		<p>The part that&rsquo;s imperfect is actually the bathroom. I realize that as [my husband] progresses I&rsquo;m going to need a drive-in shower for him. I&rsquo;m just not going to be able to wheel the chair, wheelchair up to the shower like I do now, and he&rsquo;s able to step in and sit on the stool. It&rsquo;ll be a little more&mdash;I&rsquo;m actually hoping that we&rsquo;re going to be moving in about 2 years. I understand that the, there might be a condo that&rsquo;s going to be built thatâ€¦they are going to have the handicapped in mind. So, late 2013 I would be hoping to be lucky enough to get into this facility because when [my husband] does have to go into residential care, he can still  come home every day and I can shower him and keep him clean, and I can get him around the house quite freely. They&rsquo;re also allowed to, once you stay in a residential care facility, you&rsquo;re allowed to sleep somewhere else 45 nights a year. So of course, yeah, I&rsquo;m going to have him home with me. And they tell me that, when he does stay in full-time residential care, we&rsquo;ll actually have more fun because I&rsquo;ve never been a wife to him. I&rsquo;ve always been a caregiver. And it&rsquo;s funny when people ask me who I am, and I look at them and I say &ldquo;Well you know, I&rsquo;m his 24/7 caregiver, I&rsquo;m his wife, and I&rsquo;m also his favourite antagonist.&rdquo; </p>
