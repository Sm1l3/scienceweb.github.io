		<p>The parts that I found more difficult to negotiate with were things like the constant layer of worry in my brain that I didn&rsquo;t know was there. It just was, and it was constantly eating away and interrupting sleep, and all of the &ldquo;what ifs&rdquo;. And it was just like, I sort of pictured it as this red layer of gelatine just sort of working a way in there, and interrupting things that I wanted to  do, and just adding a layer.</p>
        <p>And the fear of that, because she was my one remaining relative at that point. But she got a bladder infection that moved into  pneumonia, and, like, out of the blue was dead within 10 days. So all of the times that I had spent, &ldquo;Oh my gosh, what am I going to do when she doesn&rsquo;t know me?&rdquo; &ldquo;How am I going to deal with moving her from where she lives into more of a care facility?&rdquo; All of those types of things, all of those hours I had spent worrying and fussing where I had this little layer in my brain that was just always aware these were decisions I was going to have to make, ends up being a complete waste of time and energy because her life ended as she would have wanted it.</p>
