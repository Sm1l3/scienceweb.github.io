		<p>So, the two months I am talking about, well, we had to meet with the community workers, the occupational therapists from the three hospitals because we didn&rsquo;t know in which hospital it would be done, thus repeating the process with each one. We lived it once; maybe we will live it a second time. We don&rsquo;t know what the future holds for us. One thing is certain; we&rsquo;ll continue our journey through this. &ldquo;When there is a will there is a way.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>How do I see the future? One day at a time, I think. Of course when you feel that your health is declining and that, in his case, you live with a cancer that you don&rsquo;t know just how far it will grow, you certainly question yourself about the spirituality, the suffering, on how can I keep my commitment, how do I see the future? I see the future with a  commitment to the end, right to the end. It doesn&rsquo;t achieve anything to worry about a future which you don&rsquo;t control in any way. You must let&hellip; You must place your trust in life; you must surrender yourself in a certain way. You do your best as you go along. And <em>que sera sera</em>. I mean, we managed in the past and we will manage in the future. We have to have some trust, we must continue our journey through this, and it is important to continue, because when you love, you love. And love is unconditional up until the end. And even after the end, the person that left will continue to inspire you and that is the way it should be, because his legacy will lie deep within you and help you grow. So that&rsquo;s how I see the future. The inspiration that he gives me now will continue to inspire me, will continue to make me grow after he is gone. And I accept what will happen. Of course, of course that&hellip; That&rsquo;s it. I don&rsquo;t have anything more to say I think.</p>
