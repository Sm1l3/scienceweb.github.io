		<p>Weddings. Ho ho! Married off both my children. For my younger children, for a number of reasons, the wedding was far from home we had to travel yet again. In retrospect, I don&rsquo;t know how I did that&mdash;how we got this multi-handicapped person to this place&mdash;but it was great  and we did it. For my son&rsquo;s wedding, he wound up in intensive care the week before the wedding. And my son came to me and said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my wedding. Everybody&rsquo;s going to ask me about dad. I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m going to&mdash;how am I going to cope?&rdquo; So, I decided since I had my husbands&rsquo; Power of Attorney, I wrote a  letter from him basically&mdash;people don&rsquo;t know how to act, so you need to tell them. By then, I was older and a little bit more experienced, so I wrote a letter that I asked the father of the bride to read to everybody who was there,  saying that this was my son&rsquo;s celebration, to please not discuss me with anybody, but make this day a joyous day with joy. And I had hoped by giving people that direction and having her father read it, that people would then know what to do. And for the most part they did. There were a few people who&mdash;I had one gentleman who came from out of town&mdash;he was even a doctor&mdash;who came up to me and said, &ldquo;This is what you have to do. Dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.&rdquo; And I said, &ldquo;Please this is not the time.&rdquo; &ldquo;But I have to tell you.&rdquo; And I said, &ldquo;But this is not the time.&rdquo; &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m leaving town tomorrow!&rdquo; and I said, &ldquo;This is not the time,&rdquo; and I just walked away. But I couldn&rsquo;t have done that 20 years before, 15 years, 10 years before. You grow into this role and you learn to realize that nobody&rsquo;s going to get it anyway, so you&rsquo;ve got to do what you&rsquo;ve got to do. And for me, that was making my husband as independent as I could, functioning as a family as best as we could, as normally as we could although normal is a relative term.</p>
