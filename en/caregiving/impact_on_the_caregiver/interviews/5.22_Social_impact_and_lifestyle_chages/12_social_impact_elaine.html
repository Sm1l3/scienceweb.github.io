		<p>We have a real large circle of friends that we still keep in touch with, have breakfast once a week with a good number of them. I used to give dinner parties all the time and I&rsquo;m finding that I&rsquo;m giving less and less and less dinner parties. Because by that time of the day, my husband&rsquo;s not functioning very well and that puts great stress on him to have people over for dinner. The last thing I want is our friends to not want to come, and sometimes that&rsquo;s very hard to see your husband or your friend not handling things very well. So, I&rsquo;ve gotten away from that kind of thing. And our friends know that if they want to see us, breakfast is great sometimes and so is lunch. [&hellip;] Good friends are very accommodating and it&rsquo;s wonderful to have good friends. It&rsquo;s an effort you&rsquo;ve got to keep that. You can&rsquo;t always expect people to come to you all the time. You have to be open and&mdash;I&rsquo;ll explain, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not so good today,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I think we can&rsquo;t come for dinner, but if you&rsquo;d like us to come for lunch that would be great,&rdquo; or meet for lunch. It&rsquo;s a short time. Then it&rsquo;s not later on in the day. That works best. </p>
