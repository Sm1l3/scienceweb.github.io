		<p>I guess I&rsquo;ve cut back on a lot of things myself now. And because he&rsquo;s not driving anymore, he wants to go and do his exercises. The Parkinson&rsquo;s have an exercise class so I&rsquo;m not doing my own. I used to go swimming, but because it conflicts, the time is not good. I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s changed, [&hellip;] but I get up early now and I walk instead and just try and work around it. But I do, I work one morning a week. I volunteer at our 55+ Centre, the older adult centre, and I really like it. I just love it because I keep my skills up. Different people, 4 hours of  just&hellip; and it&rsquo;s a happy place. So I haven&rsquo;t quit that, but some of my other things I&rsquo;ve quit. Like through the church and stuff like that, I don&rsquo;t do that  anymore.</p>
        <p>Yeah, I used to volunteer for the Magnus Theatre, a little theatre group here. And I enjoyed that, but it&rsquo;s at night and he&rsquo;s so tired at night. I was just finding  it too stressful to go and leave him. And I&rsquo;m okay with it because I&rsquo;ve done it for about 20 some years and it was time for a little change. So, the things that I have quit, I&rsquo;ve been comfortable with. So it isn&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t feel put out about it.</p>
