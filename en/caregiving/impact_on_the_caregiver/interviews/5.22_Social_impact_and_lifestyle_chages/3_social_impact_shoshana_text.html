		<p>He would criticize&hellip; if we had someone here,  he would criticize something I might have done. Lately what it is is I&rsquo;m not doing things the way he would do things, and it&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;Big deal, right?&rdquo; Like, it&rsquo;s not a big deal. But it is to him. I don&rsquo;t word sentences the way he would word them. He&rsquo;ll say, &ldquo;You mean this,&rdquo; and I say, &ldquo;No, I mean what I said originally&rdquo; because I&rsquo;m not wording it the way he would word it. And these are little things, but this is what  it&rsquo;s coming to. And he will criticize things when there are people here and that&rsquo;s very embarrassing for me because some people will tell me later, &ldquo;Oh, he was very harsh to you,&rdquo; or something. Some people will say&mdash;it depends on how  well we know them&mdash;some people we don&rsquo;t know well and I&rsquo;m worried what they&rsquo;re  thinking. It sometimes affects our social life. Do I want to pursue a new friendship with another couple? I don&rsquo;t know because that makes me very nervous…because it&rsquo;s not something I share that he has this illness right away. But if they don&rsquo;t know it, they wouldn&rsquo;t understand his actions as behaviour. He can be a lot of fun when we&rsquo;re with another couple, but he can also be a little rough around the edges. And do I want to take that risk of introducing a new couple to our social circle? I have to think long and hard before I do that. I have to decide if I want to prepare this couple for what he has. Because he also lately, he just says things straight out and doesn&rsquo;t think about the other  person&rsquo;s feelings. He didn&rsquo;t used to be that way. </p>
