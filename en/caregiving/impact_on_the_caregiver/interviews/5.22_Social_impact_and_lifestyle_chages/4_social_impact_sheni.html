		<p>I have no&hellip; tolerance, I guess you would say, for people who have minor problems and whine about them. And that affects my relationships with a lot of people, because they&rsquo;ll be whining about something that&rsquo;s like really, really minor. And yes, it&rsquo;s a problem for them  and I understand that, but if I only had those problems I would be jumping for joy. If my kid flunked a course and had to take it&mdash;oh, actually my son has, because when he was on chemo he flunked a lot of courses because he was too sick to go, and you don&rsquo;t get a tuition rebate when it&rsquo;s half way through the term. So I have accepted the fact that&mdash;I don&rsquo;t care&mdash;I&rsquo;ll gladly pay for more courses. You just take them again. It&rsquo;s not a problem.</p>
        <p>Other people whose kids flunk courses, they&rsquo;re complaining and whining, &ldquo;Oh, they flunked a course. They&rsquo;re never going to be a success in life.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m like, &ldquo;Give it up man. Be thankful your kid&rsquo;s healthy!&rdquo; So that has tainted my relationships with a lot of people because of the anger and the fact that I&rsquo;m constantly reliving a lot of the crap that I&rsquo;ve been through and people don&rsquo;t want to hear about it anymore; that&rsquo;s affected my relationships with people. So from a psychological perspective, it&rsquo;s had a really negative impact on me.</p>
