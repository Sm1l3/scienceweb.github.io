		<p>So I don&rsquo;t think my experience as a caregiver is unique. I think a spousal caregiver has a very unique experience as compared to a child caregiver. I think the children, young children, go through hell and don&rsquo;t realize it and don&rsquo;t know how to cope with the nice things that people say that are all wrong; that are terribly guilt-ridden, riding, imposing, guilt imposing on these children. I had to teach my children that it&rsquo;s okay to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to their father, who would call them every 2 minutes to pick up a pen that dropped or get something. It&rsquo;s just, you can&rsquo;t do that to a child; they&rsquo;re not your caregiver. That&rsquo;s a whole different piece. And you as a mother watching this&mdash;seeing how it affects your children, seeing how your children are so ambivalent between wanting to help and hating to help, and how it affects them&mdash;and trying to deal with that, that&rsquo;s a whole different volume. </p>
