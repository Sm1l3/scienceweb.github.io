		<p>Because people don&rsquo;t want to come over, it&rsquo;s not interesting! Him, he sleeps. And you, well, you have thing to do when he&rsquo;s sleeps. You take advantage to do the things that you can&rsquo;t do when you are&mdash;when he is awake. Because &ldquo;I want this&rdquo;, &ldquo;I want that&rdquo;, &ldquo;come sit&rdquo;, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of seeing you move around&rdquo;. So, friends distance themselves, so you don&rsquo;t have a social life anymore. You don&rsquo;t have a family life anymore. And you are isolated completely.  So, that&rsquo;s why the associations helped me, and it&rsquo;s them too that informed me ofcertain rights that I had, that I didn&rsquo;t know of.</p>

I don&rsquo;t see anybody. I don&rsquo;t work anymore. I don&rsquo;t go out.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;What do I have to talk about?&rdquo; You don&rsquo;t have anything to talk about, so you feel belittled and put yourself down.</p>
