		<p>So that was part of my culture, I mean, so that&rsquo;s our duty. My sister-in-law came from USA to help when my mother was in the hospital. I never even thought of that I could go out to get any help for her. I say, &ldquo;Well, we are supposed to give help.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s all I knew, that&rsquo;s all I knew at that time. But the moral support, I think, I was looking somebody [who] could come and talk, or even if, whether I&rsquo;m doing a good job or not a good job or anything more has to be done. Somebody else has to tell you sometime. You cannot be your own judge. So that is moral support. &ldquo;Okay yeah, this is okay. This, maybe she would like. You can do this,&rdquo; or even little things makes lot of difference. That sometimes I miss because the culture I come from, neighbours come. There are more relatives. You have so many relation your mother&rsquo;s side, father&rsquo;s side, cousins, their family. So, they all come and sit with the patient and give you little break or moral support&mdash;that was missing here. And that really I felt, I wish I had more family members here.</p>
