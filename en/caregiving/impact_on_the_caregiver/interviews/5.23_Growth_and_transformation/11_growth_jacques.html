		<p>Well, it might keep me from having Alzheimer&rsquo;s. No, not really. No, but only the positive aspects, it&rsquo;s that it&hellip; I can tell you one thing, caring for my daughter, it has kept me from ageing. It didn&rsquo;t force me to age; it kept me from ageing. I have that impression. Because I&rsquo;m taking care of her, I don&rsquo;t have the time to think that I&rsquo;m getting older, or whatever. I don&rsquo;t have time. So, I think that&rsquo;s the positive aspect to  caregiving. For some, it will make them sick, but for me it&rsquo;s the opposite. It gave me the motivation I needed. And having met these people&mdash;having told my story to them, got help and all that&mdash;that really helped me as well. And I think that…my temperament is such that I am not negative. I&rsquo;m more positive, so&hellip; I have everything connected, that&rsquo;s what she gave me as means, so I try, as much as possible, to love my daughter, and to help her, and to keep going. That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s important. </p>
