		<p>Developing a close connection with my mom. I think we have a bond. I think it can be unhelpful at times, but I&rsquo;ve been lucky to develop the relationship that I have had with her, and it wouldn&rsquo;t be the same if it weren&rsquo;t the way that it is. I also feel lucky that I  appreciate her so much because I feel like every day could be her last day on the planet. And so, I live every day as if she died tomorrow , already I&rsquo;m okay because I&rsquo;ve lived like that for the last 10 years, so I think every day could be her last day and I&rsquo;ve said everything that I feel I need to say, and I honoured our relationship in a way that I feel  okay with. [&hellip;] So that&rsquo;s one of the things my friends are always saying &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re so good to your mom and you really know,&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s not something I wish on anyone to have to think like that &ldquo;Like oh, my mom could die tomorrow,&rdquo; every single day, &ldquo;or today,&rdquo; but it changes the nature of your relationship so you really appreciate that person.</p>
