		<p>Life was never meant to be easy. So nobody&rsquo;s going to hand you a platter with a bunch of, a book that says this is how you deal with life. It doesn&rsquo;t work that way. You will always be learning throughout your life. There&rsquo;s never a mistake. It&rsquo;s a learning experience. So when something happens, dive in. And you can always say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I didn&rsquo;t know&rdquo; or, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know to do it that way. Thank you for telling me.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s the way I&rsquo;m looking at life now, and I don&rsquo;t give a shit who hates me right now. You&rsquo;re, if you&rsquo;re going to like me as a friend, or advocate, or whatever I&rsquo;m going to tell you the truth and I&rsquo;m not going to lie to you. I&rsquo;ll be kind  to you, but I will not lie to you, no.</p>
