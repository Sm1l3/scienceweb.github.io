		<p> Oh boy. The life lesson is that you&rsquo;ve really never got your life figured out because , all of a sudden, you have&mdash;what is this saying that I&rsquo;ve always lived  by?â€¦I know I&rsquo;m going to forget it, but it&rsquo;s about what you had planned. In order to live the life that you have planned, you have to give up those things  because now, all of a sudden, you&rsquo;ve got this in your life. So, to be rigid and say, &ldquo;Oh, this is how I wanted it to be and now it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; you&rsquo;re only going to fight the brick wall, right? So, you&rsquo;ve got to bend, you&rsquo;ve got to go with the flow. I always tell my granddaughters that you&rsquo;ve got to go with the flow and life throws you this curve then make the best of it&mdash;make the best of it.</p>
        <p>And for us, getting involved in our support group at first, I thought, &ldquo;What are we doing here? These people don&rsquo;t interest me. I&rsquo;m, I don&rsquo;t even want to see somebody who looks worse. I don&rsquo;t want to see what happens with Parkinson&rsquo;s.&rdquo; Well that&rsquo;s turned out to be a very silly attitude, because you are going to find out one way or another what happens with Parkinson&rsquo;s. And how you deal with it is everything. It&rsquo;s everything for your family. It&rsquo;s everything for your friends. I firmly believe we still have the number of friends that we have because we do always try to be positive people, and people don&rsquo;t hear us whining about what we do. Like people  say, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I couldn&rsquo;t do what you do Elaine.&rdquo; And I say, &ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t know I could do it till I was doing it.&rdquo; So until you&rsquo;re in that, why say you wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
        <p>My daughter got cancer. Her little girls were 3 and 5 years old. Well, I was just so grateful that I was able to step up to the plate then and help her. I had people say, &ldquo;Oh, I couldn&rsquo;t do what you do.&rdquo; Well, that&rsquo;s silly. Of course you&rsquo;re going to do it, or how could you deny your daughter help, how could you deny your husband help, or your mother, or your father, whoever you&rsquo;re looking after? I couldn&rsquo;t live with myself if I didn&rsquo;t. </p>
