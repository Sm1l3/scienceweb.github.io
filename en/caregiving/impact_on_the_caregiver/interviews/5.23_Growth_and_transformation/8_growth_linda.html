		<p>It&rsquo;s the greatest gift you can give to  another human being. To give yourself, to give your life for another person. Like I said, there are some people who are so selfish or they are so needy themselves they could never carry out this task. Caregivers are tough, and you better believe it. We&rsquo;re very tough people, we&rsquo;re fierce, we&rsquo;re warriors. We fight just as hard as the victim does, if not harder. The tougher it gets for us, it just makes us all the more tougher. I&rsquo;m determined. It&rsquo;s not going to  break me. I&rsquo;m not going to let it take me down. It&rsquo;s an honour, an honour to look after [my husband].</p>
        <p>It&rsquo;s just really a fulfilling and happy, to know that I&rsquo;m a success. I&rsquo;m not a failure; I&rsquo;m a success. I can do it and I&rsquo;m doing a good job. I know it. I know I&rsquo;m good. Even though I&rsquo;m powerless, I still feel I&rsquo;m in power, and I&rsquo;m just bound and determined; I&rsquo;m going to keep my man at home with me as long as I can until I have to come to the mature  decision to change our lives once again. But for now, we have our happy home and [my husband], he loves my cooking, and we&rsquo;ve got the cats and us, and we just live out every day and try to be happy somehow.</p>
