		<p>In almost all the cases that I&rsquo;ve done caregiving, and it&rsquo;s been a fair number of them by this time, there has been an incredible amount of joy. There has been an ability to recognize when a life is done: that  sometimes when you are only seeing somebody once a week and you&rsquo;re not as involved in their life and you&rsquo;re not dealing with all the little crises that happen from day to day, somebody&rsquo;s death can come as a real surprise, and  really knock you back. Whereas when you&rsquo;re a caregiver, you see the slow breakdowns of the body reaching its final time, and it makes the death of the person you&rsquo;re  caregiving much more a natural process, rather than being a complete shock.</p>
        <p>And after the death, the feeling that you were there for them, you did the best you could do. There&rsquo;s always going to be regrets in there; you always think &ldquo;Oh geez, I should have done that,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Gee I wish I had noticed that earlier,&rdquo; or there&rsquo;s always stuff. But, I think if you hold onto the joy of what you were able to share with that person through  their life and through their death is, I think, a huge bonus in your life.</p>
