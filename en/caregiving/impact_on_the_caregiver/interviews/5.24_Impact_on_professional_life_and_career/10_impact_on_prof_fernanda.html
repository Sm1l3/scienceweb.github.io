		<p>Please understand that, even though your life, maybe that you&rsquo;ve never had to take care of anybody, that it is extremely hard to take care of somebody and have a job. I&rsquo;m not asking that employers say, &ldquo;Okay, you&rsquo;ve got to take care of somebody, so you can have all this time off.&rdquo; No. I&rsquo;ve never been like that. Whatever time I&rsquo;ve had off, I&rsquo;ve worked it in. If I&rsquo;ve taken an extra half an hour at an appointment, I have worked in that half an hour. I&rsquo;ll come back in the evening and I&rsquo;ll finish my work. I try to leave everything. A lot of times I can&mdash;I used to go in at 2 o&rsquo;clock in the morning while mom was in hospital. I&rsquo;m not asking for freebies, but I think the people that have a job and have to  run people to appointments because there&rsquo;s no one else&mdash;I mean just nobody else&mdash;and you can&rsquo;t put them in a taxi or expect them to catch a bus because they&rsquo;re too sick to do that, or they don&rsquo;t know the language&hellip; is please have some understanding what&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s like. Because when I was told after my dad died and my mother and [&hellip;] they told me that my mom had about two weeks to live if she  didn&rsquo;t go back on dialysis, and I was told&mdash;and not by the employer&mdash;that business is business and no one really cares, that was a big shock. Because you know what? It&rsquo;s true. As long as people, businesses, are out there to make  money and everything, and so it&rsquo;s just really, really hard.</p>
