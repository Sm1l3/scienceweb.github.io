	  <p>So another side of this&mdash;what is a joy&mdash;but professionally it&rsquo;s completely changed my life. So I&rsquo;m an academic and for the first 15 years, 14 years of Oliver&rsquo;s life, there was no way that I was going to  confuse my research and interests with disability. Partly because I felt that was self-interest and partly because I felt that I had other things that were really more interesting to me. And over time, that feeling of self-interest has given way to other sensibilities, but also just my own understanding of disability. And I&rsquo;ve had a chance to start teaching course and perspectives on disability and injury and so forth. And that has been so enriching for me because it&rsquo;s  getting myself out of the mindset of &ldquo;everybody with a disability is just like our son&rdquo;. Trying to understand this vast diversity of things that come under this label &ldquo;disability&rdquo;, and the consequences that has for the human condition, both positive and negative, has been rewarding, hugely rewarding for me professionally. And it&rsquo;s gotten me into all kinds of new relationships with  different people who work professionally in this sphere of academia. Again, those are relationships that I otherwise wouldn&rsquo;t have made, but I&rsquo;m so glad that I&rsquo;ve made them.</p>
