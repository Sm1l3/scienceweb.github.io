		<p>I was not expecting to lose my job, and certainly we were expecting my father eventually to die. So, I think his death and losing a job at the same time in my life was very hard on me but I had to push it behind me in my head because  my mother was becoming more and more in need of help. So I was in mourning in a  way, and also becoming more and more of a caregiver. That gave me a sense of, like I knew what I was doing. There was a focus, a sense of knowing the situation. I&rsquo;m taking care of mom&rsquo;s house and I&rsquo;m helping mom. So, I knew I could deal with that. [&hellip;] Something  concrete, whereas my father&rsquo;s illness and his death was something I had to learn to accept or live with. I had never lost a parent before. I had never&hellip; and the way I lost my job was&hellip; I was like stabbed in the back. It was one of those bad situations, and that was very frustrating to me. So instead of maybe really dealing with those 2 things&mdash;the loss of a job and my father&&rsquo;s death&mdash;taking care  of a house and my mom was something&mdash;or she was appreciating it. [&hellip;] It was concrete and I could get, I could feel pride doing it. I was helping her remain in her home and I felt pride in doing it.</p>
