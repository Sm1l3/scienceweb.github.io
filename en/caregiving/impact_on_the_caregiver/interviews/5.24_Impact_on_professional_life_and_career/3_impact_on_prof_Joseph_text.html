		<p>It was in 2007, January 2007. And so, I was working two days per week, and was on sick leave three days per week. That worked for me and in that context, I asked for pre-retirement. It was about 32 years&hellip; I was in my thirty-second year of work at the hospital. So, at that  moment, I made a request for pre-retirement, which according to the documents was like one year. So you make you request, and next there is a delay. Then they accept, then it is for a year, then after that you can take your retirement.</p>
        <p>And so, it was about February that I made my request, and in March I received a response that said, &ldquo;Okay, listen. We accept your request&hellip; &rdquo; given that, at that time, I was 55 years old. &ldquo;You can take your retirement. You don&rsquo;t have to follow the whole process, and if you want, you could take your retirement on December 10, 2007.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Well, that better than I thought.&rdquo; So, I was&hellip; I no longer had the desire to work, I no longer had the motivation&hellip; The work was no longer motivating me and personally I was like lost and searching for myself. And, I was no longer well.</p>
