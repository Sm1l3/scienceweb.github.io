		<p>So moving forward, probably about the summer of 2007, I was at a point where I needed a job. So, I got a job doing barista&mdash;I was a barista&mdash;and I also got a job as sales worker, retail. And it was good. It got me out of the house and it allowed me to have a little financial security. And it was very interesting at this conference I just attended how most youth caregivers suffer from presentism. Like you&rsquo;re present at work, but my mind was never really at work. I remember, like, I got a lot of flack at my retail store because I might have overcharged someone or did something wrong on the computer. And I apologized for it, but I knew I didn&rsquo;t want to say it, but I knew that was because my  mind was probably thinking about what&rsquo;s going on with dad because he was by himself. My mom was at work and so it was difficult. Like, I enjoyed the fact that I was out, I was doing something productive other than cleaning toilets, but I know  that work definitely suffered because of the fact that I was thinking about my dad. And not that it was a bad thing. I think if I would have told my employers, I probably would have gotten a little bit, you know, some slack in that term. But  it&rsquo;s like in the documentary says; it&rsquo;s definitely a stigma. You don&rsquo;t want to tell the world that your family isn&rsquo;t perfect. [&hellip;] You want them to think that  you have a perfect family; there&rsquo;s nothing wrong.</p>
        <p>But it came to the point where work was really suffering, and I was eventually fired. But before that, like at the barista, I had to quit because it was just getting too much. And then I was fired from this job, [&hellip;] but when you&rsquo;re looking back on that experience, that was probably the best thing to happen because that was right about the time when we were in the final stages of dad&rsquo;s life. So at that time, that&rsquo;s when I became his full care attendant for him. And 3 months prior to that he had twisted his ankle. And being a diabetic, that was going to take months and months and months to heal.</p>
