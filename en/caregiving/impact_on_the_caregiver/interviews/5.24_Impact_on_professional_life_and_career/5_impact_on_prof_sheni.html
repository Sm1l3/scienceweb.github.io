		<p>So I don&rsquo;t know, it was just, it was a problem in a lot of ways. Like, I just found it really difficult to manage all this stuff. I had so many times where people would call me. One time&mdash;my husband takes the mobility bus to go to his day program and they can&rsquo;t seem&hellip; well, I had to sign a waiver saying that it would&hellip; like, he doesn&rsquo;t have to do the hand-to-hand transfer, that he&rsquo;s quite fine being dropped off at the house and nobody has to be here when he gets here. Well one day, they phoned me at work; nobody was home, the door was locked, and he had forgotten his key, so they phoned me at work. I&rsquo;m downtown; they&rsquo;re way out [&hellip;] in the suburbs, and they&rsquo;re like, &ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s nobody here and he can&rsquo;t get in.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m like, &ldquo;Okay.  Well, I&rsquo;m at work. Even if I leave now it&rsquo;s going to take me like an hour and a half to get home. What do you want me to do?&rdquo; Like, you find yourselves in these impossible situations and these people are&hellip; they wanted me to waive my magic wand and solve the problem, and I really don&rsquo;t know what to do. What do you suggest? &ldquo;Well, we can keep him on the bus for a while.&rdquo; Like, &ldquo;Okay. Well then keep him on the bus,&rdquo; or [&hellip;] he just hangs out at the front of the house for a while, or he can take a walk to Loblaws&mdash;he does that all the time. Well, they wouldn&rsquo;t have that; they wouldn&rsquo;t hear of that, right. Eventually he ended up coming in through a window. But these are&hellip; you run into all kinds of really, like, situations that are really difficult that most people just never&mdash;people that aren&rsquo;t in this situation dealing with these kinds of problems they, they never have to deal with these situations, and they can&rsquo;t imagine how difficult  it is.</p>
