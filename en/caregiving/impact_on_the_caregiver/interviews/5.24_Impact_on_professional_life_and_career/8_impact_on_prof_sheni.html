		<p>He ended up going for 6 weeks of radiation treatments&mdash;every day we went down. I had to take time off work because I basically had a breakdown and I just&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t function anymore. And I had to&hellip; I just, I took this time off and I drove him down every day and he went for the radiation treatments. And we dealt with all that. And the poor guy, he was like so tired, lost half of his hair, and it was just, it was just really, really difficult. But anyway, after that the tumour shrunk a little bit and the last MRI that he had they said that the tumour was&hellip; well, they said &ldquo;stable&rdquo;. So that was back in December. And after, because he had gone for the radiation and the tumour shrunk a bit, and because he&rsquo;s taking the drugs on a regular basis&mdash;like, not missing any, and they increased the amount of drugs that he&rsquo;s taking and the combination of drugs&mdash;he&rsquo;s actually, he was seizure-free for more than a year. And so he got his licence back. And so now, he&rsquo;s able to drive again, which is a huge benefit to him and me because, when he wasn&rsquo;t driving for over a year, I mean, I was the taxi. I was driving him all over the place and I felt&mdash;I mean, I had to do it. It&rsquo;s my son; I had to do it and I wanted to do it.</p>
        <p>But you know what? It&rsquo;s so difficult to play taxi all the time, especially when you need to get up for work early in the morning and kids like to stay out late&mdash;they like to stay out late&mdash;and so, I would often have to say, &ldquo;Well yeah, I can pick you up, but what it can&rsquo;t&hellip; it&rsquo;s not going be 12 midnight. It&rsquo;s going to have to be 11, I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; And so, I would feel bad cutting back on his social time, but there&rsquo;s a limit to what you can do as a caregiver. Like, you&rsquo;re not, you&rsquo;re not superwoman, you&rsquo;re not superman and you&rsquo;re not a magician. And it&rsquo;s so hard because you get so, so tired;  physically tired, emotionally tired, drained. It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s brutal.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>And how did you manage to continue working in all this period?</strong></p>
        <p>It was extremely difficult. It was to the point where&mdash;I mean okay, when my son had the seizure in the summer of 2010 and I just couldn&rsquo;t work anymore; I just couldn&rsquo;t. My manager was fabulous, a really amazing lady who totally understood. I told her, I said, &ldquo;Look, I have to take time off,&rdquo; and she says, &ldquo;Not a problem.&rdquo; But my other manager, my team lead, when I told him I said&hellip; he basically said I had 2 holidays&mdash;2 one-week holidays&mdash;booked in the summer, and it was the first holiday that I cut short, and then I had another holiday coming up a couple weeks later. And he says, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re done with your holidays, right?&rdquo; And I said, &ldquo;No I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;As a matter of fact, I&rsquo;m taking five weeks off.&rdquo; And his response was, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re kidding me, right?&rdquo; Even though he  knew what had happened, his response was, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re kidding me, right?&rdquo; And I said, &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not kidding you. So suck it up because, I&rsquo;m sorry, but you know what? My family comes first.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>So it was very difficult for me at work and another thing that happened was that I would have to take a lot of time off, like for various appointments like meeting him to go to the doctor&rsquo;s for check-ups and MRI results and so on and so forth. And I would get a lot of comments from people. Like, if I went out for a couple of hours, they would make comments like, &ldquo;Well, are you coming back?&rdquo; And so, I was getting really, really sick and tired of these comments that I was getting from people, and it really&hellip; I think in the end that maybe one of the reasons that they terminated me was because they didn&rsquo;t like the fact that I was not available 24/7 even though I put in more than my fair share of hours. It&rsquo;s just, in IT when you&rsquo;re doing  application support, it&rsquo;s just never enough. I mean, they would expect you to be up all night and come to work the next day, like if you were on-call and you had to&hellip; you were woken up at 2 in the morning and you were up for 3 hours, they&rsquo;d expect to see you atâ€¦bright and early the next day.</p>
        <p>So, taking time off didn&rsquo;t go down well with some people. Now, having said that, other people were fine. Like, when my son had brain surgery, I had managers that were so nice to me that [&hellip;] they let me have extra time off with pay, so that I could stay home longer while my son  recuperated. So I&rsquo;ve had various different responses from people. You get some people that are really nice and really understanding, really compassionate, and you get people that&mdash;they don&rsquo;t care about&hellip; they don&rsquo;t care about anything that happens to you, like, they just don&rsquo;t care; all they care about is themselves. So, you get quite a variety of responses from people. But yeah, it&rsquo;s been really difficult because most days, like a lot of the times when I&rsquo;d go to work, I would be just dead on my feet, and a lot of the times because of all the problems that I&rsquo;ve had I have not been able to sleep at night. And if I can&rsquo;t sleep at night then&hellip; if I&rsquo;m up for a few hours in the middle of the night, well I finally will get back to sleep, but then when the alarm goes off at 7 o&rsquo;clock, I&rsquo;m so dead tired that I can&rsquo;t, I just can&rsquo;t get up. So, I would be late a lot. And most of the people that I worked with were&hellip; they were understanding, and they covered for me when I was late.</p>
