My boss was super helpful in that. I don&rsquo;t know what she thought of it, but she took it appropriately. She offered me the necessary support, the employee assistance program was there. Given that this is an organization that deals with psychiatry, well theoretically, they should be understanding, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that all the administrators are.  But there are predispositions to that. And so, I received great support from my place of work.</p>
