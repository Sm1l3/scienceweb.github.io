We were both self-employed and so we didn&rsquo;t have any kind of benefits to fall back on. So when this happened to him, he went from having income to having&mdash;like a fairly decent income&mdash;to having no income at all. And then 2 weeks before the second incident, I lost my contract job. So, we went from having a really high family income to having zero income and zero benefits. No long, no long-term disability benefits, no unemployment, nothing to fall back on, and so that was  a really, really&mdash;another stressor that was added onto all of this.</p>
