		<p>Yes, Assistive Devices Program in Ontario enabled us to buy: he has, [name husband] has a scooter suitable in the house; and he has a big old scooter that we&rsquo;ve had for years that he uses outside on the lawn, and he has a trailer hitch on it even&mdash;I think he&rsquo;s the only guy with a scooter and a trailer hitch&mdash;and he has fun with that  outside; and then we have one for the van. So, we have a scooter larger than the one from the house, and we can take that shopping and take that wherever we need to go.</p>
        <p>And in the van there&rsquo;s a lift. So the lift, I think it was almost $4,000, and we had to pay that.Â But the scooter on the lift, there again, I think we only paid $600 for it, and it&rsquo;s probably a $2,000 scooter. So the  government kicked in for that, and of course anything spent because of a chronic illness is a tax deduction. So we always save all our receipts for the drugs that we pay, and the dispensing fees and everything. It adds up pretty sizable. Some years it&rsquo;s been around $10,000 that we&rsquo;ve laid out for scooters and walkers and drugs.</p>
        <p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s expensive but we&rsquo;re fortunate. He&rsquo;s got a good pension and we live simply and those things become priority. So if I was looking at a fancy fur coat that wouldn&rsquo;t be on the priority list at all. A new scooter overrides that any day. So you just have to make your choices. I feel very badly for people that don&rsquo;t have a decent pension, and they&rsquo;re inability to say, buy a van to fit the scooter. It&rsquo;s tough yeah, very tough.</p>
