		<p>I mean, an ambulance call costs $80. Again we have had thousands of dollars of ambulance calls in the last 3 years, all of which have been covered by our extended medical. But if we didn&rsquo;t have extended medical, BC medical doesn&rsquo;t pay for ambulance calls. We would have been paying for all those. So, I mean, we&rsquo;ve been, we have been really fortunate that way because if you had to add all that financial pressure on the top of everything else&mdash;whew!&mdash;that would be a really big one. And now they want, they try and charge you $30/day after when they figure you&rsquo;re not acute at the hospital. So, anyway&hellip; You learn all these things, I tell you. I&rsquo;ve learnt way more than I ever wanted to know about any of this stuff.</p>
