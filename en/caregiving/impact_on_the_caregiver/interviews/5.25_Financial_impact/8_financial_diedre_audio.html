		<p>I&rsquo;m lucky because I have had some personal resource&mdash;resources, well like having extended medical. I mean honestly, if we didn&rsquo;t have extended medical&hellip; My husband is now on palliative pharmacare, which I didn&rsquo;t even know existed until some doctor in the hospital put him on it. So that&rsquo;s great because now everything, all his medications, are covered regardless, and some  over-the-counter medications&mdash;that someone who is considered palliative needs&mdash;are covered. So that&rsquo;s fantastic, but you know a lot of people don&rsquo;t know about that. I have a friend who&rsquo;s caregiving for her husband, who&rsquo;s quite a bit older than her, and she didn&rsquo;t know anything about that. I told her. I said &ldquo;Get your  doctor on that,&rdquo; because [&hellip;] I mean, I didn&rsquo;t know about it until the doctor did it, and we&rsquo;ve got money for&mdash;through our Extendicare&mdash;for equipment and nurses if we need it. [&hellip;] And family assistance plan, because I have availed myself of stress counsellors fairly frequently to give myself some support, but most people don&rsquo;t have that.</p>
