		<p><strong>And you talked about the financial impact?</strong></p>
        <p>It is really very, very significant and we&rsquo;ve often talked about, because I think it [is] probably about $40,000 a year after tax dollars. We keep saying wouldn&rsquo;t it be wonderful if this could be something, if the tax system could try to accommodate this by at least saying &ldquo;take  this stuff off first, and then calculate what your base income is for tax purposes.&rdquo; And when I say after tax dollars, I mean, that&rsquo;s a huge amount of money.</p>
        <p>And then, when we go on a trip&mdash;like we just  came back from a week away&mdash;well, we need 24/7 coverage for when we&rsquo;re away, and it&rsquo;s not as though you can say &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have someone pop in and observe.&rdquo; You have to have someone to give Oliver his medications, to feed him, to diaper him, to bathe him, to do everything.</p>
        <p>If you really want somebody to do the job that you want them to do&mdash;to love and care for and nurture and enjoy&mdash;you have to pay them something that at least allows them to be in the world. I mean, I&rsquo;m talking like $17 an hour right. That&rsquo;s not a lot of money, but after tax  dollars for a family, it&rsquo;s a huge amount of money. And so, I think the issues around this are on both ends of that; partly it&rsquo;s the level of care that&rsquo;s required and partly it&rsquo;s the level of reward that people need so that they can also live in this community. And I&rsquo;m not talking about buying mansions or you know having a triple digit salary or anything like that. I&rsquo;m really talking just about getting by as a young person. </p>
