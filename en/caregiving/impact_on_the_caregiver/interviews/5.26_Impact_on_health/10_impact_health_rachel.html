		<p>So I&rsquo;ve been going to that group, I guess,  almost four years now. They meet once a month and we take summers off. And the leader of that group is a therapist and her brother has MS. And I started seeing her privately as well, so she&rsquo;s also been an absolute godsend. I think anyone who is caregiving needs to see a therapist. And not anyone though; it needs to be someone who is in line with your moral compass and your values and who you respect, and my therapist actually remind me of my mom a lot! But she is great. She has got me out of dark places and I donâ€™t see her that often  anymore because she&rsquo;s given me the tools to do it on my own. But I still check in with her every so often. So that has been very, beyond helpful, that support group who&mdash;they are just my friends at this point really&mdash;and then, as well, the therapist. And then just surrounding myself with people who are up to having honest and real conversations.</p>
