	  <p>What the renal unit had which was a phenomenal source of support for me, and I don&rsquo;t know if they still have it or not, was when shortly after dad, shortly after dad died and after mom went back on dialysis and I was going through a really tough time, really tough&mdash;I was trying to juggle the job, mom&rsquo;s appointments, I didn&rsquo;t know if she was going to, trying to deal with the grief of losing my dad, I don&rsquo;t know if she was going to make it or not&mdash;and I was just really, really overwhelmed. And, her name was [name social worker], and she was a type of a social worker, and she would come and see me at my work for an hour. So, I&rsquo;d take my lunch once a week and she would come and talk to me. And there were times there when I don&rsquo;t how I would have done it, because she gave me the skills. By talking to me and by making suggestions and understanding. And whenever I had these feelings and I&rsquo;d say &ldquo;how can I be feeling this?&rdquo; the words out of her mouth were always, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s normal. You&rsquo;re okay.&rdquo; When you don&rsquo;t feel okay, when you don&rsquo;t feel normal, she was a huge support for me and again, this was by the health region and I don&rsquo;t know whether they offer it anymore or not&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think they do. And she in turn, her husband got cancer and she became a caregiver, so it&rsquo;s funny how the wheel sort of turns around.</p>
