		<p>I do know that I had been stressed out, this is&mdash;we&rsquo;ve been here six years&mdash;five years ago, right after Bill had a heart attack. Sorry, it was before Bill had his heart attack. They call them anxiety attacks&mdash;your muscles hurt in here. And I had two of them. One was on New Year&rsquo;s Eve and it would have been, it would have been &lsquo;07, and it was New Year&rsquo;s Eve and we were supposed to go out. We actually had plans to go to the bar and it was, it was a dinner, a special dinner for New Years, so a sociable drinking. And we had our tickets and I got this severe chest pains. And they were so bad that I thought I was having a heart attack and I went to the hospital. And they treated me just like a heart attack. They gave me whatever pill it was, and it actually worked. It cleared oh half my head; it felt great. I was sick from it though, and I had a bad night. Anyway, that episode passed. So whenÂ Bill had his heart attack, even the paramedics when they got here said he wasn&rsquo;t having a heart attack; his ears were bothering him, just his ears. And he said they&rsquo;re irritating him and he did have trouble breathing because I even said, &ldquo;Should I call someone?&rdquo; And he says, &ldquo;No, you call an ambulance.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; He was alert; he talked to me. I managed to get him from upstairs to down here because I knew the&mdash;what do you call it?&mdash;the hospital bed thing would not fit in my house, right. I knew that much. So anyway, but when the paramedics got here said, &ldquo;Oh no, he&rsquo;s not having a heart attack.&rdquo; They sent him to the next town over and then he had to go into Saskatoon. And by that time his heart actually stopped five times and  they&mdash;oh yeah, they put two stents in his heart. I forgot that.</p>
        <p>So anyway, about a month after that, with  all the stress I had another attack. And this time our good friend was with us  and he ended up taking me to the hospital. And I was treated there, and this time the doctor realized it was muscles. He pressed on my chest and realized it was muscles. And they still treated me for a heart attack and said, &ldquo;You need help,&rdquo; stress wise and counselling and all that. So I went right into  counselling and stuff like that.</p>
        <p>So from that time though, I was in really, really bad shape, I started to get my energy back. My friend came and helped me more, helped me with Bill, helped me drive, did everything basically, he&rsquo;s like my mother okay. My mother always took control. My mother was always there for me, helped me here and there, and that&rsquo;s what he did. And I  eventually, I got my life back onto track and now that I find out it could have been allergies&mdash;you know anything&mdash;but it was just too much stress.</p>
