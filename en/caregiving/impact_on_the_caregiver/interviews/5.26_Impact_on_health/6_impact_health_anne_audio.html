		<p>I went through many years, and it was really hard and very stressful on me, and I hit a point where they thought I had a heart attack, but I didn&rsquo;t; I really had a stress break, a breakdown or a stress whatever. I ended up in the ICU unit for coronary care because they thoughtâ€¦and when they started talking to me, they realized that it was pure stress that had done that to me, and they made me stay in for a week, which was great because I just slept for a whole week. It was really nice. Isn&rsquo;t that terrible? That you have to get to that point to take a break? And then after that, I started looking at it more, meditating, trying to figure out ways more to deal with things because it had been just too stressful for many, many years.</p>
