		<p>I&rsquo;m not depressed. I do go through suicide thoughts, and most of that is caused by I want to escape. I just want to get out of it. So I was advised to go for a 20-minute walk; not 10 minutes, it has to be 20 minutes and I have to get out of the house and relax. I believe in God and if it wasn&rsquo;t for him, I wouldn&rsquo;t be here today because when I do have a bad situation, I&rsquo;ve taught myself to go to bed and tomorrow things will look better, but also I find for me I&rsquo;m safe in my bed, and nobody can hurt me. So, that is my sanctuary and I can go there and wait for the pain to pass. Sometimes I can&rsquo;t do that; I will sit in my car in the garage put my music on as loud as I can handle it and sit and cry. And I find sometimes things just get overwhelming and they pass easily.</p>
        <p>Like I said, I do pray to God&mdash;there&rsquo;s a lot of people don&rsquo;t believe in him, but right now that&rsquo;s the only person that seems to save me. Because when you get to a certain point, especially when you can&rsquo;t tell the difference between right and wrong, you&rsquo;ve hit that&mdash;yeah, you&rsquo;ve got to get help&mdash;but you&rsquo;ve got to, you got to come to your senses, and it&rsquo;s hard. And I was really close one time, very, very close. And I had all these ideas  going through my head on how I could escape this world. And when it became a reality, I knew something was wrong and I did seek help. But at that time, what did I do? I think I went to bed. I took Gravol and went to bed. But that&rsquo;s the closest I&rsquo;ve ever come to&hellip; but I was lucky because I was able to still have  enough common sense&mdash;you know how you&rsquo;ve got the good and the bad in your head, and your conscience. I have a guilty conscience all my life. So my conscience finally said, &ldquo;No!&rdquo; You know what I meant? It was that close, but I had enough common sense to say, &ldquo;Wait. You&rsquo;re still…this will get better.&rdquo; And I started convincing myself and saying &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll get better. Okay, let&rsquo;s think of something else and tomorrow&hellip; you can do this tomorrow.&rdquo; And tomorrow never comes, but I was able to snap myself out of it and if I&rsquo;m correct, I had written to [&hellip;] my friend and then I took Gravol and went to bed. I had to sleep it off, and a lot of  times you wake up in the morning and you forget a lot of it. I even forget most of the time. I wake up and go &ldquo;Hey, today&rsquo;s Tuesday… and oh yeah, I was in a bad mood last night wasn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; </p>
