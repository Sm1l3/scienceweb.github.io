		<p>Find a source of help. Psychiatry is good except that often there&rsquo;s a wait time.Â  You might, if you&rsquo;re expressing a suicide concern, go to your doctor and perhaps you can get into see a professional sooner because of that. Don&rsquo;t be scared to say that you&rsquo;re, you know&mdash;if you&rsquo;ve got a good doctor they will react. Find someone who understands it. Find someone who&rsquo;s been there, done that. Again, probably through a support  group or through this website you can find someone possibly who&rsquo;s been in that situation. But don&rsquo;t let it go long like my situation with feeling like I was drowning. Don&rsquo;t let it go that far when you&rsquo;re only hanging on by two strings. Get help when you recognize it and when you see it, and you know that there&rsquo;s a problem and you&lsquo;re scared. Get, get some sort of help somewhere. Go to your doctor, go somewhere and get some help. Hopefully they can connect you with the right places, because it&rsquo;s too hard when you&rsquo;re getting too deep. But find some source. Now they have the Internet; you could find some sort of source. Talk to people that maybe know someone else that know someone else. But it requires a little bit of work, and a little bit of mental preparation, if you&rsquo;re not too far where you can get to that point to get help. Like, don&rsquo;t wait; get help right away, before it goes to a suicidal point or something like that.</p>
