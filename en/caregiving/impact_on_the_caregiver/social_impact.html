<h1>Social impact and lifestyle changes</h1>

<p>The people we interviewed  noted that caregiving had an important impact on their social life, lifestyle, and/or  family life. Some felt that caregiving definitely  enriched their lives, sometimes in unexpected ways. </p>
<div class="purpleBox">
	<a style="float:left;"><img src="../profile/100x100/07_Lillian_Michael.jpg" /></a>

<p>Some caregivers spoke about being able to maintain  very active social lives. For example, Elaine maintains a busy social life,  partly because she became actively involved in the Parkinson&rsquo;s support group.  Marc and his friend take part in a lot of social activities and Marc feels he  would not be able to do without socialization. On the other hand, many  caregivers had fewer social activities when they took on more caregiving  responsibilities. For some this was okay, but for others it was problematic.  Donovan said, &ldquo;I feel very strongly inside of me that I desperately need  socializing and I&rsquo;m not getting it. Because we&rsquo;re isolated at home, very  isolated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Several  caregivers felt that they did not have a social life anymore. For many years,  all Anne did was work, come home, and look after her kids. Now that she is  older, she notices that she doesn&rsquo;t have as many friends because of it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Reasons for a reduced social life</h2>
<p>Caregiver&rsquo;s  social lives declined for several common reasons. </p>
<div class="purpleBox">
	<a style="float:left;"><img src="../profile/100x100/images/00_text.jpg" /></a>
  <div class="purpleBoxContainer">

<div class="clear"></div>

<p>Several caregivers simply felt  too tired or too busy to be socially active. You will be able to read more  about this in <a href="../personal_challenges/caring_for_yourself.html">Caring for  yourself</a>.</p>
<p>Matsonia said, &ldquo;I give him his meds at  7:00 in the morning. And so, I make all our appointments for the morning  because that&rsquo;s when his mobility would be the best. If I have a dinner party,  that means people come over at 11:00 and we have some drinks, some wine, or  whatever, and we sit down and eat at noon and then they leave by 2:00 in the  afternoon because he starts turning into a pumpkin after 12:00 to 1:00.&rdquo; Another  caregiver, Rachel, made new friends that were more understanding of her  situation as a caregiver.</p>

<h2>Effect on lifestyle and family</h2>
<p>Several caregivers started  caring for a family member, a spouse, or a child while raising young children.  Some of these caregivers expressed concerns about what effect the caring had on  their children. </p>
<div class="purpleBox">
	<a style="float:left;"><img src="../profile/100x100/images/00_audio.jpg" /></a>
	<div class="purpleBoxContainer">

		It can be challenging for children to grow up in a situation where one parent is sick and needs continuous care. Shayna tried to find the right balance with her family.

<p>Several caregivers describe how the caregiving affected  their own lives and personalities. Kai, for example, was still very young when  he cared for his father and he feels he has become socially awkward as a result  of spending much of his time with adults and not with friends his own age. </p>
<p>Some  caregivers appreciated the opportunity just to be alone once in a while. Joanne  said that it is a nice idea to have the house to herself for one day: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  probably do all the same things that I always do, but I&rsquo;m alone. I can yell,  scream, jump up and down, watch TV all night if I want, whatever, just dance  around my living room. But I would be alone. It&rsquo;s just a luxurious feeling to  be alone in my own house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many  caregivers also noticed changes in their lifestyle that impacted their health,  such as eating unhealthy foods or smoking. You can read more about this in <a href="impact_on_health.html">Impact on health</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Friends and isolation</h2>
<p>Over time, most caregivers  experienced a reduction in their number of friends. Many caregivers felt that  the illness made friends disappear. When Shayna was planning her son&rsquo;s  wedding, she realized that she had a third fewer friends to invite to her son&rsquo;s  wedding compared to her daughter&rsquo;s wedding which was 7 years earlier.</p>

<p>Caregivers experienced  isolation in different ways. Rowdyneko felt emotionally isolated, commenting  that others did not understand unless they had had a similar experience.  Similarly, Mrs. Smith  felt that she had nobody to turn to, and decided to go to the local caregivers  group. </p>
<div class="purpleBox">
	<a style="float:left;"><img src="../profile/100x100/33_Madhu.jpg" /></a>
	<div class="purpleBoxContainer">
		<div class="purpleBoxContent">

<h2>Finding solutions</h2>
<p>Some caregivers explained that  they had started inviting people to their home more frequently as it was easier  for them to receive people at home. Shayna also discussed the importance of  being invited to social events even if the care recipient cannot attend. </p>
