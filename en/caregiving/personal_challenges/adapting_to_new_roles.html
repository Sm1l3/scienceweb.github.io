<h1>Adapting to new roles and key issues for spouses</h1>

<p>In  this page you can read about peoples&rsquo;  experiences as they found ways to adapt to their new responsibilities and accept  their role as a caregiver. You will read about how caregivers talk about  changes over time with their care recipient, and how spouses adapted to their  new roles. Most people we interviewed had experienced a particular point when  they realized that, in addition to being a parent, partner, child, or friend,  they had also become a caregiver for their loved one. This did not mean that  everybody was necessarily feeling comfortable with the title &ldquo;caregiver&rdquo;, or  with their role. You can read more about this in the topic page <a href="#">Becoming a caregiver</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Acceptance of the caregiver role</h2>
<p>The people we interviewed accepted their roles differently. Some caregivers spoke about having to accept the role in order to deal with their responsibilities. Others felt the responsibilities were thrust upon them. Michael said, "I think you just have to accept who you are and move forward because if you stand on the sidelines and just are angry that you are in this and you can't get past that, you're really headed for trouble."

<h2>Loss</h2>
<p>Several caregivers experienced feelings of progressive loss because of the changes experienced in their care recipients' health or behaviour over time. Christiane said, "You lose a bit, then a bit more, then a little bit more and more." And Alyce describes it like this: "I lost my husband, and the way I best describe it is 'he went overseas and he never came home,' and that's the hard part."

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Changing roles</h2>
<p>In several situations, the roles or relationships between caregivers and care-recipients changed as the illness progressed. Many caregivers started to take over certain tasks that the care recipients used to do before, such as looking after personal finances or daily tasks like taking out garbage and household cleaning. For some, this was a difficult process; for others, it was a moment to reflect on their responsibilities and roles.</p>

<p>Several caregivers noticed that there was a dramatic shift in roles. Several adult children that cared for a parent noticed that sometimes they were treating them more like the child. In Kai's situation, this was difficult because he was still young while he cared for his father. He said, "I had to watch him as a hawk, and that was a very difficult thing because I had to do it in a way that, again, I wasn't like the parent in the room. Like, I wasn't making sure that he needed to do this and do that. I had to do it very lightly, but I needed to make sure he took his medication."
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Spouses adapting to roles</h2>
<p><br />
Spouses who were caring for an ill spouse experienced other important changes. For example, they spoke about how society seemed to have different expectations for when you cared for a spouse compared to when you cared for a parent or a child. You can read more on this topic in <a href="#">Society and caregiving</a>. </p>

<p>Several caregivers spoke about how, often for practical reasons, they had to stop sharing the same bedroom. Shayna spoke about moving out of their common bedroom: "There are definite stages, and there's no guidebook on how you do this. I know he was upset." 
</p>
<div class="purpleBox">
	<a style="float:left;"><img src="../profile/100x100/37_Elaine.jpg" /></a>
	<div class="purpleBoxContainer">
		<div class="purpleBoxContent"> Elaine  had to stop sharing a bed with her husband when he started having violent  dreams from Parkinson&rsquo;s disease.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<p>Caregivers described the strange position they were in as spouses. Rowdyneko said: "I've spent sort of one foot in the single camp, being single or widowed or whatever you want to call it, for several years, and then this other foot over here where you still have a relationship but you can't do anything with either of them." Richard described it like this: "You're a partner without a partner. Or you're a married widow or widower." <br />
  <br />
  Most spousal caregivers described a change or reduction in their feelings of love and affection for their partner. They also spoke of the loss of being sexually intimate with their partner as the illness progressed. </p>
<div class="purpleBox">
	<a style="float:left;"><img src="../profile/100x100/images/00_audio.jpg" /></a>
	<div class="purpleBoxContainer">
		<div class="purpleBoxContent">Anne  feels she has lost her marriage. &ldquo;When somebody&rsquo;s chronically ill, they don&rsquo;t  have the energy or the patience.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div class="clear"></div>
<p>Alyce describes it like this: "It's a special kind of love; a love that you grow in together. I mean 25 years is a long time. You struggle with 'Oh, I don't know if I'm going to make it the second year.' You don't know if you're going to make it the seventh year. We had troubles, we had lots of troubles, but we worked it out." <br />
  <br />
  Not every caregiver lost their feelings of love and affection, however. Matsonia, for example, met her partner when he was already diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and continues to have deep affectionate feelings for her husband. </p>
<div class="purpleBox">
	<a style="float:left;"><img src="../profile/100x100/10_Linda.jpg" /></a>
	<div class="purpleBoxContainer">
		<div class="purpleBoxContent">For  Matsonia, knowing her husband is the best thing that has ever happened to her.</div>

	</div>
	<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>There were also some caregivers who put some extra effort into maintaining intimacy in their relationship.</p>
<div class="purpleBox">
	<a style="float:left;"><img src="../profile/100x100/37_Elaine.jpg" /></a>
	<div class="purpleBoxContainer">
		<div class="purpleBoxContent"> For Elaine, it is  important to find a way to have some intimate moments with her husband.&nbsp;</div>

<div class="clear"></div>
<p>Some caregivers had considered divorce, but stayed with their spouse for different reasons. Sheni and Alyce both indicated that there were few, if any, other options for them to stay with their husbands. And  one caregiver said, "How would people view a well spouse leaving an ill spouse? I would be viewed as a heartless, terrible person." <br />
  <br />
  Illness and taking on a caregiving role can challenge relationships. Two  caregivers described how they had a relationship with someone else in the period that they were caring for their wives.</p>
