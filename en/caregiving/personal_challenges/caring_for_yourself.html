<h1>Caring for yourself</h1>

<p>Caregivers almost unanimously  spoke about how busy they were keeping up with their caregiving  responsibilities and their day to day lives. Although it was often difficult to  keep to any sort of routine, many tried to take time for physical activities  such as walking, yoga, cross country skiing, and other forms of exercise.  Others took time to meditate, write in a journal, volunteer, read a book, shop,  listen or make music, or paint. For several caregivers it was also important to  socialize with their friends, people from support groups, or through e-mail. H&eacute;l&egrave;ne joined Facebook  for fun and rediscovered some long lost friends who have now become an  important part of her support network. </p>
<p>Most people accepted the fact  that they needed to find time to care for themselves in order to continue providing  support for their care recipient. However, most people we interviewed felt that  this was a big challenge. In this page, you can read and listen to how  caregivers tried to care for themselves, the difficulties they encountered, and  what kind of changes they had to make. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like Fernanda, other caregivers encountered difficulties when trying to find the time and the energy to take care of themselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Difficulties in caring for yourself</h2>
<p>Lacking the time or energy to care for oneself was a major challenge for most caregivers we interviewed. Matsonia, for example, said, "I don't really have the energy to go out there and work out in a gym. And then, the rest of the time during the week, it's not like I can leave him alone while I go work out."

	</div>
	<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<p>Sometimes it takes some time to find the right activity. Marc said, "But at the same time, one must take measures to look after oneself. I started taking regular walks with a friend, twice a week. But I searched; I searched because when you are depressed, you... Well, you are not happy, you become silent, you are affecting your partner, and you are affecting your friend (Marc's care recipient)."
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The turning point: Insights</h2>
<p>Many caregivers experienced a point when they realized they had to make some changes in order to continue giving care. For example, Joanne and Richard both realized that they needed to make some changes after experiencing symptoms of burnout. Rowdyneko and Sheni took time off work when they were too busy with their caregiving and felt they were close to a breakdown. Rowdyneko said, "My stress counsellor told me I had to take a leave. I really didn't want to take a leave from my job. And I still am conflicted about that, because in some ways, my job was respite from caregiving."

		<div class="purpleBoxContent">Taking  care of yourself doesn&rsquo;t have to cost much. To H&eacute;l&egrave;ne, little things can be a big help.</div>

<p>Many caregivers found that doing sports or taking time for their own interests helped them cope better. They often felt physically better, able to "check in" with themselves, relieve stress or adopt a different focus. Several caregivers dealt with difficult times by doing meditation, journal writing or singing. For Lillian and Michael, singing together helped them to slow down and process what was going on around them.

<div class="clear"></div>
<p>Several caregivers found help in reading books, Mike learned for example that it is ok to say "no", even to your own mother. For Joanne, it helps to read that others go through similar feelings and experiences.

<p>Shoshana attended an information evening for caregivers. Listening to the speaker there gave her some new insights: "She was a very good speaker and she talked about a bouquet of balloons and, how there was strings and each one would let go, and she said, 'Don't wait until you only have one or two balloons left to get help.' She said, 'Get help when you have a lot of strings to hold onto, because you may be too late for your help if you wait till you only have a couple strings left'. I remember her saying that and that was when we went for professional help after that." Many other caregivers sought help from counselling services to help them through the more difficult periods. You can read more about this on the topic page <a href="../impact_on_the_caregiver/impact_on_health.html">Impact on health</a>. <br />
  <br />
  In some cases, couples who cared for someone together spoke about the importance of taking time for each other. At the same time, they said that taking time for oneself and connecting with friends were also important. Still, the caregivers valued respite time and a yearly holiday, if and whenever possible. You can read more about taking time for <a href="traveling_holidays.html">Travelling, holidays and respite </a>. <br />
  <br />
  The caregivers we interviewed described how changes in their own way of thinking helped them to cope with their situations. Lorna said, "I've had to learn to kind of talk to myself and not get frustrated. […] So I'm feeling pretty positive about it right now. But it bothers you, right? You've just got to try and think a different way."

<p>Several caregivers found a source of strength and support in spirituality or religion. Alyce prays to God and feels this helps her through difficult times, especially when she comes to the point where she can't tell the difference between right and wrong. Hélène also prays and says, "I pray a lot, every day. And that too, it kind of brings a type of a peace when it gets to be too much. I don't know. It just seems to relieve some of the anxiety or the pain, and before, it's not something that I would have talked about or thought about."
