		Trying to find the right balance

	  <p>So, I came back here, my wife was in the hospital and,  well, I slowly familiarized myself with the environment. It took some adapting  to return. And so, that was… Then next, well, my partner returned and we  started in terms of our relationship… a little different as well as seeing  thing and I… Some requests were made, the difference at that moment was that  before I left, while my perception or my views were, well, my partner is in a  particular context, and I will do everything that is in my power to prevent her  from suffering, so that she can enjoy life as much as possible. So, when she  made a request, I tried to respond as much as possible, and then… But there  were requests that weighed me down, or that I found heavy, that I had  difficulty to respond to, or I was like reacting to, but with my view of  things, it was to allow, as much as possible, to experience pleasant things. <br />
	    <br />
	    PART 2<br />
	    <br />
	    Ok, when I had requests, I was there and I was weighing  the pros and I could allow myself to say, “No, I’m not comfortable with that.”  Or I would say, “Yes, okay, I will do it.” So, it was like different, and I was  much more selective, anyway, in my perception of things. I was much more… When  I returned, the demands were like… we said, “We tried organizing everything  during the six months that I was not here, so you can continue to organize  yourself, and you’ll use me the least possible.” And little by little, it was  like balanced. There was a trade-off at one point. I was trying to fulfill all  the demands. Then I left, responded to nothing at all. And now, I try to find a  balance, a balance that I set to respond to the needs. It’s when I receive a  request, sometimes, that rings inside, it’s grrrr… You know, I am like  reacting, and I am not comfortable with that request, and at that moment, I’ll  say it. And then in a normal way, I will say, “Well, I’m not able…” I will not  fulfill it. And then sometimes….<br />
	    <br />
	    Sometimes, maybe, I will… I will not be too comfortable,  but I will think about it and […] this discomfort will fade away and I will be  able to respond to this request. So, I am in the… and I am in the process of  balancing, trying to have balance between what I am able to fultil, and what  can be offered. Or the requests may be fulfilled by someone other than me. And  I am in the process of managing that and balancing it. And I am aware that it’s  not perfect. But, in any case, me personally I live much better in the  situation I am here. I have the impression of having a better balance and…<br />
	    <br />
      Anyway, me personally, I live much better now. </p>
