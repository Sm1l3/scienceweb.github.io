	  <p>How do I see the future? Well, I guess as a family  caregiver, for me the future is 5 minutes from now.  I try not to cast a net too far ahead of me  because I’ve learned in 34 years that things can change on a whim, and the idea  for us in what we’re doing is maintain my mother’s current functional abilities  and her quality of life. I think that the best piece of advice I’ve ever heard as  far as trying to balance the home versus facility environment is, and the  possible guilt of being a family caregiver, is that I would never want to wrap  myself into such a tight ball about having my mom at home for the rest of her  life. So, rather than promise or make a promise to a loved one that I’m going  to keep my mom at home forever—and she obviously won’t understand that anyway, but  for my own sake—it’s more about looking at the promise that she will always get  the best care possible. And if the best care possible is at home, then so be  it. But it doesn’t necessarily always mean that. So for me, the future is: she  will always get the best care possible. I would love to believe that it’s  always going to be as part of our family unit. […] The immediate sort of  short-term future challenges are going to be my family life—my kids and where  they’re are at in their current lives, they demand more and more out of me and  my wife. The medium-term future for us—and I mean fingers crossed—but I  certainly hope my kids to some degree are active participants in the caregiving,  and they come to appreciate the fact that what we’re doing is something you can  continue into the future. But does that mean I know exactly what the future  looks like? Not really, other than a pretty firm commitment to ensuring that  her quality of life is the highest we can possibly make it. Ultimately, I know  that—whether that’s at home or not—I’m still going to be as a family caregiver.  I’m still involved 24 hours/day, 7 days/week; it just may take a different  shape, so to speak. <strong> </strong></p>
