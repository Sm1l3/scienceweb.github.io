	  <p>I think it can be a really beneficial thing if you allow  it to be. Again, I think it’s finding balance and knowing who you are and  finding yourself and still taking care of yourself. I think, honestly, taking  care of yourself first is the most important thing. It’s like when you’re on a  plane and it descends and you need an oxygen mask, and you put your mask on  first and put anyone else’s on second. That can be really difficult. <br />
	    <br />
	    And again, being a woman, I think that can be difficult.  We feel the need to take care of others and take care of ourselves second. But  [by] not taking care of yourself first, then I’m sure you’re not taking as good  care of someone else [as] you could. So really, take care of yourself to take  care of the other person. <br />
	    <br />
      And healthy boundaries. I think that’s taken me just the  last year or two. I’ve really learned what that means, and so sometimes my mom  will call and ask for something and sometimes the answer will be no. I think  that’s honouring her as a person to not just to do whatever she wants me to do.  And she can be really demanding! I don’t have to be there all the time. I don’t  have to be, and I shouldn’t be expected to be. I’ve sacrificed a lot and that’s  fine; that was my decision and I’m happy to do it. It makes me feel good to  know that I’m there for her and I can increase her quality of life, which is  really […] my biggest goal. It’s just, to do whatever I can to increase her  quality of life, but to a point. I’m not going to take away from my quality of  life— sometimes I will—but for the most part, I’m not going to take away my  quality of life to increase hers. I’m her daughter and she wants me to be  happy. So taking care of me is really honouring me, and honouring her. </p>
