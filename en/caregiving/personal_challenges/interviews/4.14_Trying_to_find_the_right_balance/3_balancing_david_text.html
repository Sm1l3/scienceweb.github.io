	<div class="text" style="width:500px; height:280px; float:left;">
	  <p>Right now I’m semi-retired. I’m a social worker by  profession and I’m working part-time. I enjoy my work but I have to be careful  that it’s not too much. I’m in the process basically of […] a transitional  period, going back from vacation to my normal life. So, I have to kind of  recalibrate that [transition] between professional life and caregiver. I’m also  a painter and that kind of feeds the soul in a sense. So, I have to kind of  juggle with all those parts. The challenge is that you don’t apply for the job  of a caregiver. You do it because you want to. It’s sort of thrust upon you and  you do it because you have to, but you’re not trained for it. I mean, there are  some things that I do well and there are some things that I don’t do so well. I  don’t have the kind of patience that trained homemakers will have. I do what I  can, but sometimes I’m just not good at it. So that’s a challenge.</p>
