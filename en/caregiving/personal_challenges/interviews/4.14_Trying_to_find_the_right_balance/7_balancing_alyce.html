	  <p>When I started out with my husband’s income, it was cut. So,  we were struggling with his pay. I actually made a list of all the provinces  and chose which ones were too expensive; they were off my list. [A city in  MB] is  my hometown. I didn’t want to go back and I said, “Hey let’s go to Saskatchewan.”  It was affordable. We bought this house, and we were able to settle down and  retire. When Bill first got here it was a miracle he—we went to a restaurant  and he knew exactly what favourite pizza I liked. I was thrilled to pieces; he  knew things. He came back to life like he was 20 years old again. Then right  after that, he went to visit his parents—now that we could afford to send him  to his parents. He doesn’t like flying; he took the bus. Well 23 hours after he  arrived home, he had his first heart attack. That was a disaster, and again he  came home on my birthday.</p>
