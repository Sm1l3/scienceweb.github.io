So, I’ve reached a point where I have much more  serenity. I got up at night. It’s positive what I have in my head! I sing to myself  and I fall back asleep. I mean, I have a lot of caring time to give him, and I  give it. And it’s not always easy. I need time for myself, but it’s like I  learned that each instant you can rest, do it. It’s important. Clear you head.  You relax nonetheless, even if it’s just 15 minutes. Just relaxing and clearing  your mind. Just commune with yourself. So, what do I do? I find that we succeed  in finding happiness through a relationship that can be time consuming, but  obviously it depends on the care recipient a lot. In my case, I chose to be a  caregiver. I chose that and I will go right to the end. I have the sense of  responsibility, of my father. I will continue with the sense of duty. And I  have the sensitivity of my mother, I do what… I find that we are in a world  where we have to help one another. It’s simple. One has to be open to  difference. One has to be tolerant. The example I have, it has to do with  physical handicap, but that goes further than that.</p>
