	  <p>Probably my last piece of advice for caregivers would be  to keep your sense of humour—to not be afraid to laugh and enjoy life. And, not  to pay attention of people who think that it’s cruel to laugh at somebody who  does something weird because of a medical condition. I mean, if you’re sitting  there with an aunt who loves eating chicken wings and she eats all the chicken  off her chicken wings, and then takes the bones and stuffs them into the vase  in the middle of the table: go with it. Laugh with it. Have fun with it.  Yes it’s, at some level sad and tragic, but if  you can’t do that, if everything that happens becomes gloom and horrible and  frightening, then your body is going to respond that way. And if sometimes you  can just sit down and have a good belly laugh—I think they call it black humour  when you’re laughing at something that isn’t sort of genuinely funny. But if  you don’t do that, you’ll just die within your caregiving experience.</p>
