	  <p>I find  that when we are suffering, we are looking for lifelines, and this is a  warning. It is testing the strength of our faith. I am answering you  differently now from what I would have answered you two years ago when my aunt  died. I was with her for 6 months while she was in palliative care. And I  cried. I burst into tears like an old lady. I cried, it's terrible. I went to  see a chaplain, and his words made me feel good. He is God's representative  with a big G, large, because for me it is very large and it gives meaning to  what you are doing. And this is also a lifelong journey. Over the years, I will  continue trying to get closer to God with a big G. This is it for me. I am  convinced that for some people, it is essential to speak to God through their  journey. Because caring for someone is also suffering. It is suffering through  love. Being a parent is also having moments when you suffer a lot. Being a  caregiver is also being confronted to this spiritual dimension. And one thing  that I would add concerning the opportunity that I have to be a caregiver, it  is the chance that I have to have met this friend. I made that choice. I  imagine that for many people they do not choose to become caregiver. As for me,  I am lucky that I have done it by choice, and I am very happy with the input of  this person in my life. And I want to highlight this input because someone who  needs help and who helps himself has gone more than half way for the caregiver.  It is a lot of inspiration, great relief at the same time when someone helps  himself. It prevents you from spending a lot of energy trying to convince him  to let you help. I find this important.</p>
