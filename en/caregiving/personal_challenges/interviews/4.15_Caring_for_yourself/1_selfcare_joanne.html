	  <p>My social life is more and more and more restricted  because of the change in her situation. It’s something I also do to myself  because sometimes I don’t prioritize my own needs as well as I should. I tend to  just keep going, going, going. I have a meditation class I go to, little things  like that, but I tend to minimize my own needs for her, thinking more about her:  “I should stay home because I’ve been at work.” She’s been alone, I feel guilty  going out again, that kind of thing. There’s some that’s related to her, some  of it that’s related to me, allowing myself to take care of myself.<br />
	    <br />
      I’ve made some changes. I can’t change who she is or how  she thinks, so I decided that I would include myself in thinking about what’s  important today or what’s the priority for this week. I’m in there too. If it’s  important for me—going out for a long walk in the forest is, makes me feel  fantastic— that’s a priority. It’s essential. It’s not a luxury and I don’t  have to apologize, because sometimes when I tell my mom I’m going for a walk, “Oh,  you’re so lucky. I can’t walk anymore”. I just don’t say, as I say, “I’m out,  I’ll be back in an hour.” So, I stopped feeling twisted up about it. I just do  it. There’s one course that I’m taking just for my own interest. So, I’m doing  that. Those  may sound like little things,  but they’re big. They’re big because I’m thinking more in terms of what do I  need? </p>
