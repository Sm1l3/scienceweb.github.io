	  <p>I’m not getting out and able to do things socially on my  own, which I know I need to do, but I don’t seem to be able to work it in. I  just found out about this one seniors’ group about 3-4 months ago, and I  haven’t been able to do a thing about it. I’m just too busy all the time. There  is so much to do to manage the situation, to manage everything: I have to look  after everything financially; I have to look after the maintenance of the  house, the yard—we have a huge yard. It’s just constant. Absolutely constant. I  don’t have any major health problems myself. I don’t have a heart problem or  lung problem or anything. I’m just getting older and getting worn out. <br />

      I started going to the gym last June. I had been hiking a  lot before then, but then that kind of petered out. So I thought, “Okay, I  better start going to the gym”. So I’ve been going 3 times/week—not for body  building, just to try and maintain some conditioning so that I can feel better.  Some people say, “Well, maybe you’re exercising too much when you go,” because  I’m tired all the time. But I was tired all the time before I started going to  the gym. So that’s not the answer either. Anyway, I spend about 2 ½ hours at  the gym working on different machines and I’ve gotten to know some of the  people there. So, I can talk or visit a bit—visit ‘a bit’. But, […] I feel very  strongly inside of me that I desperately need socializing and I’m not getting  it because we’re isolated at home—very isolated.</p>
