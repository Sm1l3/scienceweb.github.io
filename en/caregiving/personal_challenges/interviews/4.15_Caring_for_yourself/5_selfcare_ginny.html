	  <p>I love to go for my walks. I try to get a buddy to go for  my walk. My sister-in-law is actually my buddy, my walking partner. We go for a  walk every morning quite early because she’s still working. So I’ll get up and  I’ll go for a walk with her. Then that will start my day. We keep each other  motivated. In the winter, last winter, we started cross-country skiing, my  sister-in-law and I.  We really loved  that, but the only reason I could do that was because my mother was already in  the interim care centre and I knew that she was being taken care of. So once my  mother was taken care of, I could start to do a few more of those things. <br />
	    <br />
	    This winter I’m hoping to get out and do more  cross-country skiing and continue with my walking. I felt like I just started  really enjoying the cross-country skiing and getting—I wouldn’t say good at  it—but starting to feel that I could stand on my skis and be able to get from  point A to point B. Then summer came; the snow stopped and we started just  walking again. […]<br />
	    <br />
	    You never know when the next crisis is going to come.  That’s the problem. Then everything stops and then life is sort of on hold for  a little while until things get back to normal. That happens when you have  something like recurring TIA’s or a fall. Those crises happen more and more.  But I am trying. I have a piano at home that I started to play a little bit  more, but again, when you’re in crisis mode I find that it stops as well. <br />
	    <br />
	    And lunches with my friends. I know I can always call them  and we can go out. They’re texting me or e-mailing me. I have a group—we call  it our book club, our circle of friends—and we get together once a month. I’ve  been there a few times. We meet at each other’s houses and I think I’ve met  with them a few times—maybe three or four times—which has been really nice. I  love to have that social contact with them.<br />
      My husband and I, we did go for a little holiday, but then  when we came back, my mother had another TIA and that’s when my I called my  brothers and they all came. So, we’re in crisis. We’re just starting to get out  of crisis mode now.</p>
