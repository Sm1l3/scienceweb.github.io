	  <p>I just opened up [the pamphlet for caregivers] and the  funny part was “taking care of yourself”. And that I had a problem with—what  [is] “taking care of myself”? I’m not going to go to the cinema. I don’t have  the money to go to a spa every weekend. And, in “taking care of yourself”, they  had “take a nice hot bath”, with bubbly whatever. That helps. And, they have a  Facebook [page], and I went “Ah wow.” […] They were suggesting, “reconnect with  old friends and you might be surprised what you’ll learn.” And it’s true. The  other one was simple things; read a book. We tend to think everything has to be  big and we’re in a society of abundance. So, treating yourself could be like, “I’m  going to change my hair.” And that’s fine, but it doesn’t have to be that. It’s doesn’t have to cost.</p>
