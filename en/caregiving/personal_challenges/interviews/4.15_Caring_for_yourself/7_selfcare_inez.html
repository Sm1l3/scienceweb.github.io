	  <p>My neighbour over here gave me a clock. I don’t know if  you noticed it when you came in there hanging on the wall in the utility room.  It’s a little square wooden clock, and all the numbers have all fallen cockeyed.   Down around the bottom of the clock it  says, “Who cares?” So, she gave that to me. She said, “This is you. You never  get stressed out of anything. Who cares?” So, when I think of things are  getting tough, I just think of the clock that she gave me and, “Who cares? Does  it really matter?” Does it really, really matter? No it really does not matter.  Be thankful for what we have.<br />

      <strong>Interviewer – Okay and based on your own experiences what advice  would you have to other caregivers or friends and family?</strong></p>
	  <p>Consider each  situation, but one of the things is “just be patient, just be patient”.  Like I said, “Who cares?” Is it that  important that you get stressed out over it, or you get angry over it or, or  depressed over it? No, no it doesn’t matter at all. Just hang in there and grin  and bear it. There’s an end and you never know what blessings will come because  of the way you acted. <br />

	    I worked in a government office for 17 years and got one  complaint against me. It came from head office. So the boss I was working with,  he said, “We’ve had a complaint against you.” And I said, “What is it?” He said,  “They wonder why you’re happy all the time.” Different people would come in and  they—[it] was a place where there was mostly men clientele—would come in mad  and going at me. And I’d just stay calm and answer their questions and show  them the rules and regulations, if that had to be and so on. So, it came back  to me different times that they would meet up then with the boss and they’d say,  “Well, what’s with her? I went in there giving her a blast and I came out  smiling. Isn’t she ever upset? Doesn’t she ever get mad?” “No, worked with her  for years and she’s never gotten angry. No.” What does it do for you? It makes  you worse. No, I’m always happy. So, that’s one thing I would say. Whatever  your situation is, just try to be happy. </p>
