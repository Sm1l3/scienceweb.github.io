		<p>For me, I read a lot of—I don’t know what you’d call  them—spiritual books, self help books, to help me with how I feel […], like  dealing with myself and my emotions and how I react to things. That’s how I dealt  with it. Because you get to points where none of it makes any sense anymore. That’s  really frustrating, when nothing makes sense. When you can’t get any help from  the medical people, when your families don’t support you. It’s a real eye  opener in life. If you just go through a normal life and nothing happens, you  don’t see this. But when this stuff happens, you see all the stuff. It’s a world  you didn’t want to know about. And that’s one thing I remember saying, that I  did never wanted to know this side of life. You don’t know it if nothing  happens to you right?</p>
