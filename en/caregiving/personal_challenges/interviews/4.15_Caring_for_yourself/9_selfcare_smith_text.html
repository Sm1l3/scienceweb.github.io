		Caring for yourself
</div>
	

	
	 <div class="text" style="width:500px; height:280px; float:left;">
	  <p>We were doing joint caregiving, so we would just bounce  [the difficult moments] off. Right now I find with my health, it is really hard  because I’m totally drained of energy. [So], we take turns. Sometimes we just  talk it over. Like today, I was really upset with what happened at the home. I  came and I cried and I went a bit, “Alright!” It keeps on going on in your mind  right? <br />
	    <br />
      […] With the experience we had with my mom, we were able to  ask the similar questions back in Holland. I, primarily, was with my mom. I was  the one who was looking at the resources and whatnot, so I would say, “Okay, we  have this in Canada. Do we have something parallel over there?” [By] doing the  caregiving jointly, it kind of relieves the stresses on each other. If he is  busy doing something, then I’ll say, “Okay, I’ll pitch in.” And when I want a  break, he’ll say, “Okay, I’ll go and do it.” So, that kind of helps.</p>
