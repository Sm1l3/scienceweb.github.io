		  So what became obvious in the hospital was that he was not  going to be able to go back to his apartment, and that he hadn’t made any  arrangements, which is something I was personally a little frustrated with  because I had talked to him about the problem with his mother not making  arrangements and that he really should. So, the end result is that there’s  nobody who has legal authority to make decisions for him. And as a result of  that, a group of friends got together as a support group for him to sort of  decide how we can share the responsibility of his needs. And, sort of, the end  result of that right now is that we’re in the process of talking to a lawyer  who is going to assess him to see if he is still capable enough to make  representation agreements, where another person will take care of the financial  stuff and I would take care of the health stuff.<br />
		  <br />
		  <br />
		  The reason I think this story is important to include is  because of the fact that arrangements weren’t made. There was no representation  agreement, advance directive, power of attorney… and because of the fact that  that… The family that actually was at all close is now all gone, and he’s 56  years old. And in our urban world, that’s going to become more and more the  case because families don’t live in the same place and they are estranged, and  for all kinds of different reasons we don’t have the sort of family community  network that we would have had 50 to 100 years ago when somebody gets ill. And  so, I think there’s going to be more and more cases where it’s a circle of  friends that have to take over and figure out how to make things work for this  person.</p>
