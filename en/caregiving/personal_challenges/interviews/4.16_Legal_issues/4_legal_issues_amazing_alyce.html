	  <p>There’s a caregiving group in [city in Saskatchewan]. I’ve  gone to them for help. They had a good project on. It was 3 different  nights.  It was fun—it really was—and  they even gave free food. Well, they just made you feel special. Like, the  little teas and little dainties, they just make you feel special. The part I  remember the most was about wills. How to write up your will, how to get power  of attorney now before something happens, banks do power of attorney, stuff  like that. That was really, really benefit to me. Prepare your funeral in  advance and stuff like that if you can, and things like that. And my mom even  taught me that write up your obituary in advance. You can put the date in later  and fill in the little details, but write up what you want to write up now when  you’re thinking calmly, because then, when you’re under stress, you don’t know  what to say, and they’re not cheap to put in the paper. So things like that.</p>
