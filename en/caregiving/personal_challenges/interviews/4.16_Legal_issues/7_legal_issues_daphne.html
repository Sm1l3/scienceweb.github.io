	  <p>I want to tell my story and I’m trying to let go of the  past. I wanted to sue those people so badly, and if you’ve got a lawyer in your  family or something, do it because you’ll win. They like to settle. That’s  another thing I found out when I was in the hospital as a professional.  Hospitals don’t like being put in the paper. They will settle out of court,  under the table. So don’t be scared. I’m sure I would have won my dad’s case,  but there’s no point right now. I think it’s… there was too much agony going  through. I did consult a lawyer, and I did have a case, and I just ran out of  energy. But I’m sure dad up there knows I did the best I could, and everybody  else does too. So winning a bunch of money in 10 years or whatever it takes… I  don’t know. No, stop it when it’s happening.</p>
