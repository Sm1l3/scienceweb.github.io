	  <p>I will go further and say that I was in that situation. I  met another Well Spouse and it happened by accident, but we formed a  relationship and we, both of us, had gone many years without having intimacy  with our partners<br />
	    <br />
	    We knew, we…how do  I go from here? It was like, it was a relief but at the same time it wasn’t  necessarily going to be permanent, but I definitely did not want to be looking  around for other women. She didn’t want to be looking around for other men, so  we were like a comfort to each other. And she was the reason why I moved down  to the States after Vivienne died. I did not tell Vivienne about her. In some  rare cases, the ill spouse, in most that I’ve heard of, the ill spouse says—and  that’s just a few—says to the well spouse, “You know, I know that I can’t  satisfy you. If you need to go elsewhere then do it, but just don’t tell me  about it.”<br />
      And so that’s, that’s what I did. But Vivienne, our  situation was different and I never told her. But my commitment to […] my  second wife was I am first and foremost looking after Vivienne and I’ll be with  her right to the end. After that, whatever happens happens. </p>
