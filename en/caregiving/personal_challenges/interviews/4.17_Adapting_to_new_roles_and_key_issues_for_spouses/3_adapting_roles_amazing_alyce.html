	  <p>I lost my husband at an early age and it hurts. It really,  really hurts. And it’s not like he died where “Okay, I can go on with my life,”  and “I’m grieving, I’m a grieving widow,” and get that kind of sympathy. No, I  get the sympathy of “her husband’s injured.” And now it just seems to be people  accept him. Even my neighbour who raised 7 kids when she met me and she said,  she said, “I’ll never forget the first day I met you.” She says the first thing  you said, “My husband has a brain injury,” and she says, “Glad I’m not in your  shoes.” I’m like “Isn’t 7 kids harder to take care of?” So, she even saw me  differently. You don’t have a social life. You lose him completely, so the  husband I married is not the husband I have today, and he wasn’t a bad guy  after all. He wasn’t drunk, he didn’t beat me, he didn’t do any of that so I  feel gypped and I already dealt with losing a son from…and that should be  enough in this world. Some people don’t even experience death. I’ve experienced  two, and now my husband doesn’t really exist either, and it’s hard. I mean my  anniversary’s coming up and I feel guilty because yeah, I’ve made it to 25  years, but you know I’m not having no wedding party, I’m not having a reception  and have friends—I don’t have any friends to invite. We’re going out for dinner,  but I don’t even know if it’s going to be fun. It’s more let it pass and forget  about it. And the only family contact I have is my father. My brothers and  sisters just don’t care and it’s not fair.</p>
