          <p>The most positive? I guess, I guess just being able to  help him. He was always the type of person that took care of any, everything.  Now the shoe’s on the other foot, and I can help him. And like he said about  the driving, “I feel so bad that you have to do all the driving,” and I said,  “Well, you know what? For the last 60 years you’ve been doing all the driving.  Now you just have to sit and let me drive. Just enjoy the ride.” That kind of thing,  just help. Cooking, I didn’t like cooking at all, and he loves it. But he has  to put up with my cooking. And I’m starting to enjoy it you know, starting to, yeah.  It’s just that I can help him I think.<strong> </strong></p>
