	  <p>The issues I had more trouble with where when I was caregiving  my spouse, because the losses were so different. When you’re caregiving your mom  or your dad, or your aunt and your uncle, there is the recognized thing that  they are going to predecease you. That’s just the way, except in unfortunate  cases, that’s the way that that the world works. So, I think your nature takes  over. The reasonableness, you’re taking care of somebody who’s considerably  older than you are, and you can be in denial until your purple, but the fact remains  they will predecease you.<br />
	    <br />
	    When you’re caregiving your spouse, adds a whole different  dimension to caregiving. You’re not just losing somebody you expect to lose,  you’re losing all of the marriage stuff. You’re losing simple things like hugs  and touches, being able to communicate about decisions you’re going to make, or  that you should make as a couple. The pain is so different than it is when you  are caregiving for a parent. So, it’s much more layered. You hurt in so many  different ways. There’s an anger in caregiving a spouse that doesn’t usually  exist when you’re caregiving a parent. So it’s a very complicated, very  complicated series of losses.<br />
      </p>
	  <p>There’s this… If you’re talking about being really angry  at your spouse because he’s got arthritis or heart problems or he’s whatever,  you’re not being a good spouse. You’re just not. You’re there in sickness and  in health. Suck it up. Just do it. And yeah, it leaves you very, very isolated  with all of your feelings about caregiving a spouse.</p>
