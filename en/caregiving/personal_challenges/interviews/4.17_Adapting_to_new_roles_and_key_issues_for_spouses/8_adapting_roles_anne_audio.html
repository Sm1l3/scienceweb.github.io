          <p>And as far as your marriage life, it kind of just  deteriorates. It’s just like a job really, because he was in pain all the time,  he didn’t feel well most of the time, he couldn’t stand to be touched because  he hurt, right? So it did, as he got older, it got worse and worse and worse so  that you’re just…it’s not a marriage anymore, it’s caregiver relationship. The  marriage has kind of gone because when somebody’s chronically ill, they don’t  have the energy or the patience, I’d say.  And as they get older, they get more miserable  and more pain. So it’s really hard to have a relationship with somebody like  that. So it’s kind of like you get older and you just kind of deal with it.</p>
