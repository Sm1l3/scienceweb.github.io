	  <p>And I remember once… I’m on my way to see her at the  hospital at lunch time or in the morning, because then, that was the time when  the doctor was doing his round, and it was possible that she might be getting  discharged and all that. So, I arrive at the hospital, and then, she tells me,  “Ah! I’m really not feeling well this morning.” My wife was there, she had been  admitted four days about, three, four days—and she said, “I feel worse now, in  any case, I feel less well than when I arrived at the hospital.” I said, “Oh!  It’s not going well.” And then the doctor comes to do his round, and I was  there. And she starts telling the doctor, “ I feel worse, I have more pain and  all that.” And the doctor says, “Yes, yes…” And he does his exam, and asks her  this question, he says, “Are you ready to go home?” Yes! That’s it! I had as a  reaction, “What is this? Did he listen to anything this doctor?” It gave me a  strong enough reaction and I talk about it and it still has an effect. And then  at that moment, well… she said, “No, not really.” He said, “Yes, we will try to  keep you still, but…” in any case. And then, she needed her personal effects,  some stuff for work as well, so I went back home to come pickup what she  needed. And I went back to see her, but I was at that moment in my transit of…  leaving the hospital, going home, and returning to the hospital. Like, I was  having an emotional reaction… but really very…<br />
	    <br />
      Yes, very intense. I didn’t have anything left. I was… I  was raging! I was yelling! I was crying, and that’s something, that never  happened to me! Never, never! And then, I was having an enormous reaction… No,  but it was just this event that sort of triggered something. And then, I  returned, I went… Then I told him, “Listen, this isn’t working. It’s not going  well.”</p>
