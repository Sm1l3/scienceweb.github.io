	  <p>What  the renal unit had which was a phenomenal source of support for me—and I don’t  know if they still have it or not—was when shortly after dad, shortly after dad  died and after mom went back on dialysis and I was going through a really tough  time, really tough—I was trying to juggle the job, mom’s appointments, I didn’t  know if she was going to, trying to deal with the grief of losing my dad, I  don’t know if she was going to make it or not—and I was just really, really  overwhelmed. And, her name was [name of social worker], and she was a type of a  social worker, and she would come and see me at my work for an hour. So I’d  take my lunch once a week and she would come and talk to me. And there were  times there when I don’t how I would have done it, because she gave me the  skills. By talking to me and by making suggestions and understanding. And  whenever I had these feelings and I’d say, “How can I be feeling this?” the  words out of her mouth were always, “It’s normal. You’re okay.” When you don’t  feel okay, when you don’t feel normal, she was a huge support for me and, again,  this was by the health region and I don’t know whether they offer it anymore or  not—I don’t think they do. And she, in turn, her husband got cancer and she  became a caregiver, so it’s funny how the wheel sort of turns around.</p>
