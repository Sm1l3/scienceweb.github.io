	    That's about it, I journeyed for six years. I met  my spouse and the years went by with him who is a willful person, who is  someone that will not be stopped by his dreams, who will take the necessary  measures whatever how long it takes him, someone who is determined. Therefore,  if you are asking what I get from this person through the 30 years, it's  someone... I am already emotional. It is someone that is very inspiring, and he  has done unique things, and I could easily tell you about few of them.<br />
	    <br />
	    Like writing a book when you can't use your hands,  get the resources to be able to obtain the equipment and be convinced that he  has a message to deliver. Believe in something even if it can be difficult. I  think that everybody is dreaming to write a book and I think that many people  refrain to embark on such an adventure because there might be obstacles. The  big question: Will I be able to find a publisher that will be willing... And for  him, it wasn't part of his questioning. “I have something to say, so go.” It  took five years; it took three years of disciplined writing where, with the  help of a friend, he succeeded. But all I want to say is that this person is  very inspiring for me. It is someone who doesn't know fear either, for example  he parachuted. My hat off to him! I said “Ok”. Personally, my reflex was to  protect him, to say “No, don't embark in this venture! It doesn't make sense,  you have enough physical limitations. What will happen? The plunge, will you  have an accident?” But it was the fear for a friend for whom I feel something.  Through his hospitalizations, I realized the strength of character that he has.<br />
	    <br />
      Now the happiest moments, there would be many to  tell you about because I have a lot of happiness with this person. I think that  his friends are proud of him. We are proud to be his friend, because we are  proud to see him achieve. And he gives a lesson to many people. And his book is  one example of this. There were 300 people who came to his book launch and it  was something really special. When he parachuted, friends came to see him but  it is a little crazy, but may be this is it, it is to believe in our dreams. It  can be done. Anything that you have in mind, it can be done if you take the  means to do it. That's... that's it.</p>
