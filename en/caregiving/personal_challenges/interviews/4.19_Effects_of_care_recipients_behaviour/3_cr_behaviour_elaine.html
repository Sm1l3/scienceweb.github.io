	  <p>I’ve been very frustrated with him because he has this  very stubbornness that he was going to keep on climbing ladders. He was going  to keep doing projects when I felt that he shouldn’t be doing this, that it was  too dangerous. And it was always my perception over his. And then I’d get mad  because he was still going to do it anyway. And I overstepped my bounds in a  lot of those times and I realized he’s got to take ownership of that himself.  If he feels he can still roof a shed then, I’ve got to let him do that. He has  still got to feel like a man, and a viable man, a man that can contribute. That’s  very important to him and I’m sure any man. […] I’m not married to couch potato.  So all of a sudden, just because his legs don’t work for him that means, “All  right, I can still crawl.” And he does. “I can still get in my scooter and cut  the grass.” And he does. And he finds out different ways of handling things. So  I’ve had to, when I spent a lot of time there being angry at him because he was  still trying to do all these things, and I had to step back and say, “This  isn’t getting anywhere. I’m all angry and upset, and I’m upsetting him, and  he’s still doing it anyway.” So I had to learn from that and I hope I have.  It’s you get protective. And I think, well, he needs this much sleep, and he  should be doing this, and he should be doing that, and that’s that power and  control again that you sort of have to stand back and let them still try to do  what they can do. But you’re so afraid that everything’s going to be gone, so  he tries still to do what he can.</p>
