           <p>It's a hard thing, because he wants to keep things sort of  as normal as possible. For instance, we've got a truck sitting out there. I  would sell the truck. I mean, he's not driving, can't drive, but he has a fit  if I suggest selling the truck because that's, because he wants to hang onto  that as a possibility. We have an RV sitting over here that's going to  deteriorate if it sits there much longer.   But again, if I suggest selling it because we're not going to be using  it, you know. So, I mean, so far I've just let that stuff go and not pushed it  because I guess you have to hang on. It's funny I mean, because the kids and I  are, we're both totally at accepting of the situation that I don't think he can—well  my son, my youngest son, figures he's going to die in the next couple of  months. And so, we're, the kids and I, are very realistic about the future. And  probably my husband is the least realistic about the future, but maybe that's  normal. But it's sometimes hard to deal with because we're almost at a  different place than he is, and wanting to move on with certain things that  he's not ready to move on with. And  that sometimes causes conflict.</p>
