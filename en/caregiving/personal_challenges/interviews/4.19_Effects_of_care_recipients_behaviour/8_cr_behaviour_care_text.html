		Effects of care recipients' behaviour

<div class="text">
	  <p>I think  that’s one of the biggest problems, because the person you’re caring for wants  to remain independent as long as possible, and in their mind, independence  includes the spouse helping them, right. They’re still independent even though  the spouse might be almost lifting them. Having to move to somebody else coming  in to do that is a big leap for them. And so, they keep wanting you to help  them do all these things, and they seem to lose the ability to think about the  other person. And this is something that I think is really important for  anybody who isn’t a caregiver—or even people who are caregivers—to realize that  that happens. Because I went through the same thing with my mother who had  Parkinson’s. And people who become disabled seem to, I suppose, they have to  focus in so much on their own needs and what they have to do to function that  they cease to be able to see the impact they’re having on the people around  them. So it’s very important for caregivers [that] they have to be the one  looking after their own needs. And they have to be aware that the person who  may be from many, many, many years would have been very considerate of them and  concerned about their well being is now unable to think that way, to see that  way. They’re so focused on how they’re going to do something and trying to  accomplish it that their mind just doesn’t seem to be thinking beyond to “you  really shouldn’t be doing this.” <br />
    <br />
  I remember  one of the last times I tried to help him was he needed to get off the toilet  and he just couldn’t. He couldn’t stand. And so, I was helping as usual, but at  one point he said, “I keep telling you! I keep telling you, you’ve got to lift  me!” Well he’s 185-190 lbs man. How am I supposed to lift a 185-190 lb man who  can’t help? Right, you’re trying to lift that kind of dead weight.  And it never crossed his mind that this was an  unreasonable request to make. And I think that’s something that outsiders would  be completely unaware of, especially if they’ve known the person all their life  and they say, “Oh, he’s very understanding, very concerned, very considerate of  his wife’s well being.” And if you talked to them about it, they would probably  say that. But at the time that they need help, they’re totally focused on the  help they need, and they seem to stop thinking about what the impact might be  on the caregiver.</p>
