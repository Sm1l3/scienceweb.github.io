	  <p>When my husband used to have an anger issue, it would  build up for a couple of days and you could see it happening. It would build up  and then he’d blow up. He was—mental abuse, I’d call it. Nothing else. Nothing  physical or anything like that. Now he is, he just blows up at you. You don’t  know if you said the right thing or the wrong thing. Even, example today, I  asked him to change his shirt. He said, “What’s wrong with the one I got?” Well,  it was a few years old; I wanted him to wear a newer shirt. I bought him a new  shirt to go out with, and he took a fit on that. The thing is he forgets in a  couple of minutes that you’ve had a fight. He’s happy again and you’re not and  he doesn’t understand that. So we also—now because he likes to sit in his  mechanical chair which he got when he hurt his neck—he likes to throw things, and  that’s not good either. So, I try to walk away. I’ve been advised to walk away,  but it’s not that easy. Told to go for walks, but everybody likes to argue back  and forth and it’s not easy. </p>
