<h1>Travelling, holidays and respite</h1>

<p>On this page you can read about peoples' experiences with travelling, their holidays, and finding respite care so they could take a break. Several caregivers were able to travel with their care recipient whereas others had stopped travelling together because travelling was too difficult.</p>

<p>While many caregivers were unable to arrange holidays for themselves, there were several who did manage. Others found respite care and took a much-needed break. To do this, the caregivers had to make (sometimes complicated) arrangements for the care recipient to stay home or go to a respite facility while they were away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Challenges with travelling together</h2>
<p>For many other caregivers, travelling eventually became too difficult. As Elaine said, at a certain point it becomes easier to stay at home. Lorna and her husband stopped travelling when they were unable to get insurance for her husband. For David's wife, it became too difficult to travel because she couldn't sit for long periods of time. Lillian and Michael's son dislikes travelling, about which Michael commented, "I think learning to unlearn those things (family holidays) is a difficult thing. If you're a family and you're going on a family holiday and you're not taking part of your family, what kind of family is that? Not taking him on a holiday is actually a demonstration of our love for him, not some sort of rejection, even though that sounds on the surface of it's crazy and counter intuitive."</p>

	<a style="float:left;"><img src="../profile/100x100/25_Claire.jpg" /></a>
	<div class="purpleBoxContainer">
		<div class="purpleBoxContent"> Airplanes are not adequately  accessible, so Claire and her husband stopped using air travel.</div>

<h2>Travelling alone or respite</h2>
<p>Several caregivers were travelling alone for holidays or business trips. Some care recipients could stay home alone and only needed someone to check up on them, whereas others needed 24/7 care. </p>
<div class="purpleBox">
	<a style="float:left;"><img src="../profile/100x100/images/00_audio.jpg" /></a>
	<div class="purpleBoxContainer">
		<div class="purpleBoxContent">When  Rowdyneko leaves for a cruise, her family tries not to disturb her.<u> </u></div>
		<a href="javascript:shadowPopup('popup1',922,630, 'interviews/4.20_Traveling,_holidays_and_respite/5_holidays_deidre_audio.html'); void(0);"><span style="font-size:14px"> »</span> Listen</a>
	</div>
	<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>Like Rowdyneko, several other caregivers had family who could step in for caregivers so they could take a holiday. Anne hired a private agency to look after her husband when she took a holiday with her daughter. Ginny paid a friend to come and care for her mother.</p>
<div class="purpleBox">
	<a style="float:left;"><img src="../profile/100x100/07_Lillian_Michael.jpg" /></a>
	<div class="purpleBoxContainer">
		<div class="purpleBoxContent"> Lillian  and Michael have developed a system to make sure their son has 24/7 care while  they are away.		</div>
		<a href="javascript:shadowPopup('popup1',922,630, 'interviews/4.20_Traveling,_holidays_and_respite/6_holidays_lilian_michael.html'); void(0);"><span style="font-size:14px"> »</span> Watch</a>

<p>Some caregivers have also used respite care services and reported having good experiences with these programs. Matsonia, for example, says the veteran's daycare program that her husband attends is a "Godsend". When he started going there, she finally had a break; it made her realize how burned out she had been. Richard's wife was able to stay alone when he would leave for respite weekends: "I would go to Well Spouse respite weekends, usually about every six or eight weeks if I could. And most of them were down in the States, but I would get there. I kind of relaxed my attitude about money. I knew that I wasn't spending it hand over fist, but I knew that it was important for me to have breaks. And so, this was money well spent."</p>
<div class="purpleBox">
	<a style="float:left;"><img src="../profile/100x100/16_Joanne.jpg" /></a>
	<div class="purpleBoxContainer">
		<div class="purpleBoxContent"> For  Joanne, sending her mother to a respite program isn&rsquo;t an option; her mother  would not be able to cope. </div>
		<a href="javascript:shadowPopup('popup1',922,630, 'interviews/4.20_Traveling,_holidays_and_respite/7_holidays_joanne.html'); void(0);"><span style="font-size:14px"> »</span> Watch</a>
	</div>
	<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>Sometimes, it is not easy to leave the care recipient behind. Christiane had a respite weekend and her husband stayed in a facility. She said, "I had a break from September 30 to October 2nd, but they sent him to a long term care facility. But there, the TV is not working. He doesn't see outside. I said: "Well, what will he do?" This is all he does during the day! There, you will not hear him, he will fall asleep. He just woke up, but he will fall asleep on the couch while watching TV. I picked him up on Sunday morning right after lunch."</p>
<p>Other caregivers leave for a short time and don't go far. Several caregivers described traveling with their cell phone ready, prepared to return home at a moment's notice. On the other hand, Fernanda enjoyed hiking above the tree line knowing she could not be reached. Still, she would check-in with her mother every night.</p>
<div class="purpleBox">
	<a style="float:left;"><img src="../profile/100x100/20_Fernanda.jpg" /></a>
	<div class="purpleBoxContainer">
		<div class="purpleBoxContent">When  Fernanda is hiking in the mountains, there is no cell reception. Although she  feels guilty, being unavailable is a relief.</div>
