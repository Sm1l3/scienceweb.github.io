  <p style="line-height:0.7em; margin-top:3px;"><strong>Age:</strong> 47-year-old </p>
	<p style="line-height:0.7em;"><strong>Age at start caregiving activities:</strong> 28</p>


	<p style="line-height:0.7em;"><strong>Her background:</strong> </p>
	<p>Alyce (47 years old)  lives in a small village with her husband and their grown daughter. Alyce’s caregiving  role started 13 years ago when her husband received a brain injury at work. Since  then, Alyce’s husband depends a great deal on her care. Alyce provides this  care despite lingering symptoms from a previous fracture  in her back. </p>

<div class="clear"></div>
	<p>Alyce and her family used to  live in the Maritimes where her husband worked for the army and studied at  university. Thirteen years ago Alyce slipped on ice and had a compression  fracture in her spine. A few months later Alyce’s husband was hit on his head  by a piece of metal heavy enough to break his helmet and inflict his first  serious head injury. He kept going back to the MRI almost daily for three weeks.  The following year Alyce’s husband had two more accidents involving his head, both  while working. During this difficult period, Alyce lost her mother to cancer. </p>
    <p>Alyce’s husband was initially  able to continue working after these series of injuries thanks to the care and  support of his family. However, eight years ago the army let him go because of his  reduced work performance, a direct result of his brain injury. Alyce is nevertheless  thankful to the army, as they provided excellent support and guidance to her  family during the first years of her husband’s illness. For financial reasons, she and her family moved to a much smaller village  in another province two years after her husband stopped working. Initially,  they enjoyed the changes and Alyce actually saw  improvements in her husband’s condition. Then everything changed again when Alyce’s  husband suffered a heart attack. </p>
    <p>Alyce has noticed that her  husband’s functionality improves when he visits his parental home, as if his mood  and brain functions spontaneously improve in this context. At home, on the  contrary, Alyce observes that her husband’s mood varies radically from day to day; he may be kind and affectionate one day  and angry and frustrated the next. However, she is currently having the most  difficulty with what she calls “the angriness and mental abuse directed towards  the family.” She was advised to deal with it by getting  out of the house and to wait until his bad mood has passed. However, this  strategy is far from enough to help her situation,  and her husband forgets about these attacks within a few minutes. Alyce struggles  with the pain she feels from these assaults and her inability to confront him  directly about it. </p>
  <p>Alyce’s caregiving situation  has negatively impacted her health; she has been hospitalised twice with  caregivers’ stress and she lives with persistent back problems. She also has  suicidal thoughts that she deals with by saying to herself that these are just moments  she has to go through. She also reminds herself at those times that she has to  go to sleep in order to wake up stronger and happier the next day. If she feels  that she needs more help, Alyce writes to a good friend who always gives her specific  advice on how to move forward. </p>
  <p>Some people have advised Alyce to leave her husband although  she does care for him and, despite the difficult situation, she feels  determined to continue caring for him. Alyce realizes, over and over again, that  she must take some time off and stay positive.</p>
