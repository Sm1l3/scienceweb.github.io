	<h1>Daphne</h1>
	<br>
	
	<img src="./daphne_files/27_Daphne.jpg" style="float:left; margin: 0 10px 10px 0;">
	
<p style="line-height:0.7em; margin-top:3px;"><strong>Age: </strong>60-year-old </p>
	<p style="line-height:0.7em;"><strong>Age at start caregiving activities: </strong>58</p>


	<p style="line-height:0.7em;"><strong>Her background:</strong> </p>
	<p>Daphne is 60 years  old, lives with her husband, and was a nurse in her professional life. She cared  for her father for two to three  years from the time he had a heart attack at 89 years old until he died recently.  Daphne describes her father as a proud World War II war veteran. Daphne’s home  is in a different province from her parents, who remained on their family farm  into their retirement.  </p>
<div class="clear"></div>
	<p>Daphne became a caregiver  rather suddenly when she went to visit her parents (she was living in another  province) following a call from her brother letting her know that her father  had fallen ill. When she arrived, she found both parents in hospital and there  was much confusion about what had happened to her father, while her mother was  recovering from pneumonia. Daphne didn’t return home immediately, but stayed  for two and a half years  with her parents on the farm to support them (returning home now and then). Her  father remained in-hospital for about a year, and then had different nursing home arrangements due to his  deteriorating heart condition and other problems, until he finally received a  place in a veteran’s hospital – where the care and professional culture was very  much more satisfactory. Her father died there after several months. Although  Daphne’s mother was at home after her illness, she was not able to help with  her husband’s care, and Daphne helped to support her as well.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
    <p>Daphne was very angry and  upset about the care her father received in the first hospital he was admitted  to. She describes the care there as woefully inadequate and downright abusive.  She fought very hard as her father’s advocate to ensure appropriate care, and  after his death was left feeling very frustrated and disappointed that the  healthcare system failed someone who had given so much for his country as a war  veteran. </p>
  <p>Although Daphne found  caregiving for her father very stressful and because of the situation she was  often angry and frustrated, she did enjoy caring for her father as it brought  her closer to him and it was wonderful to feel so useful during the last years  of his life. Daphne found great support from family, friends and a counsellor  who helped her cope through this period; with her expertise as a professional  nurse, she was a strong advocate for her father’s care and was not afraid to  stand up to the healthcare professionals that she felt were not meeting basic  quality standards of care. She believes that had he received timely and better  care, he would have had a better quality of life for his remaining years. She  would like governments and those working in the healthcare system to pay more  attention to caregivers and to improve the quality of care provided to sick  older people in hospitals. </p>
  <p>Daphne feels strongly that caregivers need to advocate  for their loved ones to ensure that they receive the best possible care. She  encourages other caregivers to find support for themselves to help cope with  all the challenges that caregiving throws your way. Daphne feels stronger and  wiser as a result of her experience; she is working hard to focus on the lighter  and positive side of life.</p>
