	<p style="line-height:0.7em;"><strong>Age at start caregiving activities: </strong>58</p>


	<p style="line-height:0.7em;"><strong>His background:</strong> </p>
	<p>David is 68  years old and lives with his wife and one of his two grown children. David’s  wife was diagnosed with MS (multiple sclerosis) 12 years ago. David’s wife needs regular support for her daily living, although  she is able to stay home alone for certain periods of time. &nbsp;David took the option of early retirement 10  years ago but he then decided to return to the workforce in a self-employed arrangement  sometime after that. Currently he is considering reducing his work hours in  order to better care for his wife.</p>

<div>
  <div></div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
	<p>David and his wife experienced  a hectic period in their lives when they were trying to find the exact diagnosis  to explain her symptoms. Shortly after the MS diagnosis, David’s wife started a  clinical trial for a new treatment for a period of two years. At that time David’s  wife was still able to drive. However, very soon after the start of the  treatment she needed somebody to drive her to her appointments. Since then, it  has been a long downwards spiral with her illness with challenges at almost every  step. Along the way, David was introduced to caregiving and his tasks increased  substantially. For David “the caregiving did not start  as being a caregiver but as becoming a caregiver”. It is not a job that he chose  to apply for and not one for which he had been trained. In fact, after 12 years  of caregiving, David feels that he still has not mastered well enough certain  aspects of his caregiving role.</p>
  <p>David retired early to  provide better care for his wife; his work and his regular activities were becoming  too much. Having a part-time, self-employed position today is still not ideal,  as David is constantly trying to find the right balance between his  professional life, his work as a caregiver and his painting. Although David’s physical  health has not been notably affected by the situation, he has been depressed  for several years and is currently taking medication for that. <br>
      <br>
      David’s grown daughter lives with them and helps whenever she can. His son, who  lives further away, also helps when he is able to. David feels that he is well  supported by their friends who remain in contact on a regular basis and respond  well to his requests. In addition, he has had a very good experience with the  services offered by his local community health centre and his wife’s physician.  He is appreciative of medical professionals who  acknowledge him as a caregiver because the darker side of his experience with &nbsp;professionals is that sometimes he is made to feel  like an invisible person, barely tolerated, and hardly recognized. This has led  to some hostile encounters with healthcare professionals. David wishes there was  a better support system around to enable him to improve his caregiving skills. He  would also like to be able to meet other people in similar situations, such as through  a caregivers support group, but as yet he has not found such a group in his  area. </p>
  <p>In spite of all this, cooking and eating good food  with his wife is something David greatly enjoys. He has also kept alive his love  for painting. David explains that when he paints he is able to focus his mind away  from his caregiving while at the same time it feeds and recharges his soul.  This enables him to continue with all of his responsibilities, in what he  describes as the never-ending process of learning to care </p>
