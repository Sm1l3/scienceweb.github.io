	<h1>Drew</h1>

	<img src="./drew_files/11_Drew.jpg" style="float:left; margin: 0 10px 10px 0;">
	
  <p style="line-height:0.7em; margin-top:3px;"><strong>Age: </strong>38-year-old </p>
	<p style="line-height:0.7em;"><strong>Age at start caregiving activities: </strong>5</p>


	<p style="line-height:0.7em;"><strong>Her background:</strong> </p>
	<p>Drew  (38 years) is married and has four children (7 to 13 years). He cares for his  mother who lives in a separate part of their family home. Drew works full-time  as a businessman with his own company at home. Drew’s mother had a stroke (CVA) when he was four years old. He has been involved in her care since  he was five years old, and has increasingly  taken over the primary caregiver’s responsibilities from his grandparents. His  mother needs 24/7care; this is organized through family care and paid  caregivers. </p>
<div class="clear"></div>
	<p>Drew was three years old  when his mother had a stroke and was hospitalized.  After nine months, her parents decided to bring  her home and care for her themselves. So Drew grew up in an environment where  family caregiving is just something you did. He  would be sent to his mother when she was anxious, as  he was one of the only ones that could calm her down. Since then, he has always been actively involved in her care  because he wanted to be involved. It progressed  from offering respite whenever he could during his university years, to offering weekend and vacation respite for his  grandparents, and eventually to becoming the  primary caregiver when he married, soon after his  grandfather passed away. He moved with his wife into the house where his mother  and grandmother lived. One year later, he and his wife decided  to start their own family and they moved with his mother to a new home. Now his  caregiver role has changed from hands-on caregiving into being more of a back-up  since he has arranged 24/7 care support for his mother.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>Drew describes different  crisis periods in their family caregiving, such  as when his grandfather died, as well as a number of  challenges: the lack of healthcare support with his mother’s changing  needs; the balancing of family, career and  caregiving; and his mother’s incontinence and loss of mobility due to  a hip fracture. He feels that caregivers are resilient people; they roll up their sleeves, address each crisis and learn  to cope. Drew says that anybody who considers becoming a caregiver ultimately has to have that inner sense of: ‘we can overcome the  majority of obstacles that come our way’.</p>
    <p>He indicates that he is not  a good caregiver if he doesn’t have an adequate balance between caregiving and  family life. He is available 24/7 for the care of his mother but also makes sure he doesn’t miss too many family activities  or moments with his wife. Sometimes the balance is right; sometimes it tips too much to the other side and then needs readjustment. </p>
  <p>One of his sisters has  actively chosen not to be involved, and another  has chosen to be involved as much as she can; Drew, the youngest, chose to  become the primary caregiver. On a yearly basis, his family evaluates the  situation and makes decisions about the best option for his mother; until now  the choice has always been the family care option,  partly because they have not yet found a better solution.</p>
  <p>He would like to see some more recognition for family  caregivers or support for accessing things such as  respite services, especially because caregivers  contribute to the public health system in a very material way.</p>
