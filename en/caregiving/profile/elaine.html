	<h1>Elaine</h1>

	<img src="./elaine_files/37_Elaine.jpg" style="float:left; margin: 0 10px 10px 0;">
	
<p style="line-height:0.7em; margin-top:3px;"><strong>Age: </strong>71-year-old </p>
	<p style="line-height:0.7em;"><strong>Age at start caregiving activities: </strong>49</p>


	<p style="line-height:0.7em;"><strong>Her background:</strong> </p>
	<p>Elaine (71 years old)  is married and has two grown children. She started her caregiving experience with  helping her parents. After this, she became a care receiver herself when she  was diagnosed and treated for lung cancer. Elaine’s caregiving experience then continued  when her husband (72 years old) was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease, 14  years ago.  </p>
<div class="clear"></div>
	<p>Elaine’s first experiences  with caregiving started when her mother was diagnosed with cancer. She still  remembers the large number of home care professionals who came to assist her  mother and how she felt overwhelmed by the whole process. When her mother  passed away, after six months of care at home, Elaine took over the care for  her elderly father who lived with Elaine and her husband. They moved to a  smaller home when her husband retired and Elaine’s father moved to a senior’s  apartment. A few months later, Elaine was diagnosed with lung cancer and, while  she was being treated with radiation and chemotherapy, she experienced for the  first time what it was like to be a care receiver. Three years after her recovery,  Elaine’s husband was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease. This moment evoked  strong emotions in Elaine, who initially did not feel ready to accept the news  of another major illness in her family. At the same time, Elaine and her  husband were relieved to learn that he had Parkinson’s disease and not a brain  tumour, for which they had feared. </p>
    <p>Today, Elaine and her  husband have succeeded in remaining positive and focus on what is possible to  do in their circumstances. Elaine’s husband enjoys working on certain tasks  around the house, even  when they may be physically challenging or somewhat dangerous for him. Elaine had  to learn to accept her husband’s tendency to put himself at risk and to not  spoil their day by being frustrated or worried by it. Although she still has periods  in which she feels regret for the loss of their former plans, she has become  more accepting of their situation and ready to face up to their challenges. For  example, when her daughter was diagnosed with cancer, Elaine was able to listen  to her own daughter’s advice to think in terms of pure reality: “this is what  it is”. </p>
    <p>Elaine and her husband have made  important adjustments while the disease is progressing. For example, Elaine has  moved to another bedroom after receiving a black eye when her husband had a  violent dream, another symptom of Parkinson’s disease. This has not stopped  Elaine and her husband from continuing to work on their closeness by spending  special times together. Elaine now appreciates the strength of her long  marriage and wishes to continue caring for her husband until the very end.</p>
    <p>Elaine and her husband have  become actively involved in their local Parkinson’s organisation. Through their  efforts, they help others diagnosed with the disease or those who are caregivers  for someone with Parkinson’s. Elaine feels that she is helping herself by  helping others. Thanks to her caregiver’s experience, she is aware of the  regret people sometimes feel once the care receiver has passed away. This helps  her to wake up every morning with the promise to be kind and happy that day,  knowing that she has tried everything possible to go through her caregiving period  in a harmonious way.</p>
