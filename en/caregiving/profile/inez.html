	<h1>Inez</h1>
	<br>
	
	<img src="./inez_files/35_Inez.jpg" style="float:left; margin: 0 10px 10px 0;">
	
<p style="line-height:0.7em; margin-top:3px;"><strong>Age: </strong>81-year-old </p>
	<p style="line-height:0.7em;"><strong>Age at start caregiving activities: </strong>73</p>


	<p style="line-height:0.7em;"><strong>Her background:</strong> </p>
	<p>Inez  (81 years old) has been a farmer all her life. She has been married to her  husband for 63 years and has four grown children who all live far from her  farm. Inez has become increasingly involved in the care for her husband over  the last nine years, while  she also runs the inside and outside operations of their home. Inez’ husband  (85 years old) was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease many years ago and his  mobility is now reduced. His memory has started to be affected by the illness  as well. </p>
<div class="clear"></div>
	<p>Inez was 18 years old when  she married her husband. The couple moved to a small house on land owned by her  parents-in-law and there they had their first three children. They proceeded to  build a bigger house and then had their fourth child. </p>
    <p>Inez’s interest and skills  as a caregiver started at the early age of six years old when her baby sister  was born and she practically took over as her mother. She then took care of her parents and  parents-in-law in their later years. Inez resumed her caregiver’s role nine  years ago when her husband was diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease. During this  period, Inez found out that she was diabetic, which she found hard to believe  initially because she had lived healthily her whole life.</p>
    <p>Inez wishes she had better medical  support for her husband’s and her own healthcare problems. There used to be a  medical doctor in a village 50 miles from their home but, they have not been able to find a replacement  since their doctor retired. In the closest village to their home, the number of  doctors has decreased from ten to three over the last few years. The fact that  the present-day doctors are from other countries does not help Inez as she  finds it hard to adapt to their attitude and working habits which are quite  different from the previous doctor’s. As a result, Inez feels she has had to resolve  most medical issues by herself. For instance, by skilfully using information  from her friends and internet to work on her diabetes she succeeded to control her  blood sugar within five months after being  diagnosed. Based on similar sources of information, Inez has also had the idea  of varying her husband’s medications he takes daily to try to reduce his  symptoms of dizziness.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Inez continues to keep a healthy  lifestyle and makes all of their meals herself. She has a wide interest in many  things and enjoys doing handiwork even if now she does not always have the time  to do the things she loves doing. It can frustrate her to do the same things  every day, and in those moments she sometimes thinks that there is no hope that  things are going to change for the better. However, her personality is such that she never gets angry or  stressed. In order to remain calm, Inez asks herself in challenging situations: “does it really  matter? Does it really, really matter? Her answer is often “no”, so Inez quickly  calms down. </p>
  <p>Inez feels that she made the choice 63 years ago to  marry her husband for better or worse, and she is determined to remain at his side  until the end. For this, she trusts the strength of the long, close and unique bond  she shares with her husband. </p>
