	<h1>Jacques</h1>
	<br>
	
	<img src="./jacques_files/39_Jacques.jpg" style="float:left; margin: 0 10px 10px 0;">
	
<p style="line-height:0.7em; margin-top:3px;"><strong>Age: </strong>88-year-old </p>
	<p style="line-height:0.7em;"><strong>Age at start caregiving activities: </strong>31</p>


	<p style="line-height:0.7em;"><strong>His background:</strong> </p>
	<p>Jacques (88 years  old) is widowed and lives with his 57 year-old daughter at home. She has been  mentally challenged since birth and has epileptic attacks regularly. Jacques’  daughter goes to a day care centre four days a week and he provides care for  her the rest of the time. Jacques is determined to continue to care for her as  long as he has the capacity to do so. </p>
<div class="clear"></div>
	<p>Jacques’ daughter attended  specialized education programs through most of her childhood. However, at age  14 her school was closed, and it was difficult for Jacques and his wife to find  alternatives for her care and education. They did their best to keep her busy  with activities at home until she reached the age of 18. During this period, Jacques’  wife became ill, and for three years he cared for both his child and wife.  Sadly, his wife died following her illness, and Jacques was left alone to care  for his daughter. In general, Jacques has always been able to find the services  required for his daughter. </p>
    <p>Jacques’ daughter is now  attending a local activity program for four days a week. This gives him the  necessary time to organize things at home to properly care for her. Among other  key responsibilities, Jacques helps his daughter perform her regular  housekeeping duties, he cares for her when she has seizures, and he brings her  to regular medical appointments. He appreciates and values the strong support  system that he has built around him. From his perspective, this has enabled him  to make the caregiving a constructive experience as opposed to a negative one. He knows the importance of taking time  for himself in order to be fit enough to continue caring properly for his  daughter. Thus, when he has some spare time, he enjoys painting - an activity in which he  demonstrates great zeal and creativity. </p>
  <p>Jacques has never considered  placing his daughter in a specialized home or institution. As a father he  naturally continued to care for her after his wife died and will continue to do  so despite that he recognizes that he is now ageing. Providing care for his  daughter is something he will continue to do so no matter what. Having been a  positively minded person all his life he does not feel troubled by his situation.  He feels that his care has helped him to not age too quickly or develop  Alzheimer’s disease, as he never has the time to think about ageing. Jacques knows  that he would not be able to do what he does without this inner strength. Throughout  his life he has found continuous inspiration and support in his spiritual  beliefs. He believes that he has been given his daughter by God and that it is  his privilege to help and care for her. </p>
  <p>For Jacques, caregiving is a lesson of love; had he  not had this love and devotion,  he would have never been able to keep caring for his daughter. And he feels  that anyone who does not feel this kind of love and devotion should question his  or her own readiness to take on such a life-long challenge. </p>
