	<h1>Joseph and Marie</h1>

<p style="line-height:0.7em; margin-top:3px;"><strong>Age: </strong>60-year-old</p>
	<p style="line-height:0.7em;"><strong>Age at start caregiving activities: </strong>56</p>


  <p style="line-height:0.7em;"><strong>His background:</strong> </p>
	<p>Joseph  (60 years old) cares for  his wife Marie who is born with numerous complex chronic health issues. Joseph  has been retired for the last three years and assists Marie with her daily  needs. Furthermore, Joseph is active as a volunteer for many different  organizations. Marie has lived independently for most of her  life yet in the last five years Joseph has become more involved in her care as  her condition worsened. She is still able to do most activities on her own in  the house although she needs help on a daily basis due to chronic pain and fatigue.
 </p>
<div class="clear"></div>
	<p>Joseph and Marie find it  hard to identify the exact start of Joseph’s role as a caregiver, in part because they perceive  the care and caregiving throughout the last eight years differently. However, the  care for Marie started to intensify when she entered a period of regular  hospital admissions about five years ago.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>Joseph, who was still  working at that time, tried everything he could to accommodate Marie in the  best possible way. He found it a busy period where he tried to combine his work  with his caregiving tasks. For example, he would interrupt his work to pick up  medications and bring them to their house, try to go to the hospital on a daily  basis during admission periods, and he tried to always be there for her in  times of need. </p>
    <p>“Patient, calm and a closed  personality” is how Joseph describes himself before and during that period.  Then he reached a point where everything changed. A doctor came to visit Marie  in-hospital and they told him that she was suffering even more pain than on the  day that she was admitted. The doctor thoughtfully looked at her patient record  and asked: “do you think she can return home today?” After this event, Joseph  screamed and cried in the car on his way back home, something he had never done  before. He started dreading the responsibilities at home, at work and in caring  for his wife. Joseph then connected with an understanding woman through the internet  and their relation became so close that he decided to leave his wife and the house  he was dreading so much, to live in the apartment of this new woman. His own wife,  out of love for him, felt happy in a certain way in that she hoped that this would  help stop his suffering. After six months, the separation period ended and a  transformation in Joseph had begun. He realized that his suffering was not  caused by the situation but by his own perception of life. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Back home with his wife, he  found a better balance between providing care and his own personal interests  and activities. Also, thanks to regular visits to the caregivers support group  and the dépendants affectifs anonymes Québec (DAA), he is now able to say “no”  from time to time, to requests from his wife, and has also been able to find  more practical solutions to complete his caregiving&nbsp; tasks. For example, he recently found out  that the pharmacy has a home delivery service, which has helped enormously with  logistics.</p>
  <p>Joseph’s transformation has opened him more as a  person. The couple has grown closer together and deepened their love and  compassion for each other. They have now reached a balance in their lives where  they enjoy the beautiful moments while Joseph performs his caregiving  activities in a more harmonious way. </p>
