	<h1>Madhu</h1>

	<img src="./madhu_files/33_Madhu.jpg" style="float:left; margin: 0 10px 10px 0;">
	
<p style="line-height:0.7em; margin-top:3px;"><strong>Age: </strong>72-year-old </p>
	<p style="line-height:0.7em;"><strong>Age at start caregiving activities: </strong>42</p>


	<p style="line-height:0.7em;"><strong>Her background:</strong> </p>
	<p>Madhu  (72 years old) lives with her husband and other family members and has three  grown children. Madhu has cared for her husband since he had a heart attack 29  years ago and he has recently undergone bypass surgery. Madhu’s mother had a  chronic stomach condition that required surgery at two different times but she  passed away following complications from the second operation. Madhu has had to make important work and  lifestyle changes in order to adapt to her husband’s illness. She is now  retired from her work as a real-estate manager but an active volunteer in  multiple cultural organizations to help immigrants with their new life in  Canada. </p>
<div class="clear"></div>
	<p>When Madhu was 42 years old  her husband suffered a heart attack. At that time she was in charge of running her  household, including the raising of their two teenage children. After three  weeks Madhu’s husband was discharged from the hospital and advised to make lifestyle  changes such as adopting a healthier diet and increasing his physical activities.  Madhu was advised not to share any worrisome news with her husband. This advice  changed her life radically: She was no longer able to share everything with her  husband and, on top of that, she had to learn to live with increased levels of anxiety  and responsibility.</p>
    <p>Eight years later, Madhu’s mother underwent  surgery for a blockage in her stomach. Her mother, who lived with the couple, did  not speak English and was strictly vegetarian. Because of the language issue, Madhu spent a great deal of time  at the hospital helping to facilitate communication between her mother and  healthcare professionals. At the same time she also had to be home with the  children and her husband and prepare vegetarian food for her mother at the  hospital. This was a difficult period and Madhu was pleased to have her sister-in-law  come over to support the family and share the work. In the four year period  following this surgery, Madhu and her mother tried to find a balance between Madhu’s  efforts to help with her care&nbsp; and her  mother’s efforts to do things herself.&nbsp; Madhu’s  mother passed away following a second surgery for similar medical problems.  Madhu still regrets not having spent more time with her mother during her  illness even though she had limited her own activities to accommodate time to provide  care for her mother and husband. </p>
  <p>Madhu is pleased with the  medical care that her family has received in Canada and feels fortunate to be  in a part of the world where she receives good care. As a child, she had fled Pakistan  with her mother at times of partition and became refugee in India. After  finishing schooling Madhu immigrated to Canada and got married and now has  three children. In spite of the good medical care she has received, she has experienced  periods of feeling isolated, missing the moral and community support that existed  in India. Madhu increasingly worries about the limited availability of adapted  healthcare services for people with another cultural background now that she is  aging.</p>
  <p>Madhu wishes that there were more opportunities for  immigrants with a medical background to work or volunteer in the Canadian healthcare  system. This way, medical professionals from India would get the chance to get  to know the Canadian healthcare system and, at the same time, healthcare  professionals would learn more about cultural issues with regards to providing  medical care for particular ethnic and immigrant groups. Madhu values the  Canadian healthcare system and makes great efforts to improve it, contributing  to improving other people’s situations is her own way to give back to society.</p>
