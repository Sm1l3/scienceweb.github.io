	<h1>Shoshana</h1>
	<br>
	
	<img src="./shoshana_files/00_text.jpg" style="float:left; margin: 0 10px 10px 0;">
	
  <p style="line-height:0.7em; margin-top:3px;"><strong>Age: </strong>54-year-old </p>
	<p style="line-height:0.7em;"><strong>Age at start caregiving activities: </strong>24</p>


	<p style="line-height:0.7em;"><strong>Her background:</strong> </p>
	<p>Shoshana (54 years  old) is married and has two grown children. Her husband  was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) when she was 23 years old. They have  remained together through different stages of his illness and care, even though the mental and social impacts of the disease have  been particularly strong, with several negative consequences  for Shoshana and her family.&nbsp; </p>
<div class="clear"></div>
	<p>Shoshana was in her third  year of marriage when her husband developed blurred vision and numbness in one  of his legs. The period prior to diagnosis was challenging for them, as the medical  assessment could only be made through a process of  elimination. A few years later, Shoshana’s  husband had to give up his occupation as carpenter. He then became a volunteer  in a school for mentally  challenged children and was later hired as a teacher assistant in that  same school. In the meantime, Shoshana has always worked as a clerk in a non-profit office. The period after Shoshana’s husband  lost his well-paid job was financially very  difficult for their family. </p>
    <p>Shoshana describes the problems  associated with this disease as “hidden symptoms” because they are hardly  visible to other people. Such symptoms include chronic  fatigue, bladder control issues and cognitive problems. Shoshana’s husband changed  from being a patient and kind person before the illness into being someone with  a short temper and a persistent anger directed towards his own wife. He also became  easily engaged in socially unacceptable behaviour, which has had a very  negative impact on Shoshana’s life. It is extremely difficult for Shoshana to  deal with her husband’s criticism or unfriendly remarks, particularly when  there are other people around. Shoshana, who enjoys socializing by nature, has now  become hesitant to make new friends because she is worried about embarrassing situations  involving her husband’s aggressive or  unacceptable behaviour. She sometimes copes by leaving their home in the  daytime for short periods, letting things blow over, and, with time, she has learned to choose  her battles with him.<br>
      <br>
      Although her situation is not easy at the moment, Shoshana explains that she has  lived through other challenging periods when, as a result of illness, her husband was  even more verbally abusive towards her. During those  periods Shoshana felt like she was drowning and unable to come up for air. She had suicidal thoughts and considered  divorce. Fortunately, Shoshana and her husband sought psychiatric help, which was  covered by their insurance, and this intervention partially relieved the  problem.<br>
  <br>
      Shoshana advises caregivers and chronically ill people to look into practical  arrangements for things such as power of attorney, advance directives for their  family members’ care plans, life insurance and disability insurance. She and  her husband have, for example, arranged for all medical  decisions to made jointly between father and daughter in the event that  anything should happen to Shoshana. </p>
  <p>She also urges anybody with similar experiences  (suicidal thoughts or psychological abuse) to find assistance as soon as  possible by going to a doctor, a friend, or any others willing and qualified to  help.</p>
