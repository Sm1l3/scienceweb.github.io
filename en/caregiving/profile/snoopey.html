	<h1>Snoopey</h1>
	<br>
	
	<img src="./snoopey_files/29_Snoopy.jpg" style="float:left; margin: 0 10px 10px 0;">
	
<p style="line-height:0.7em; margin-top:3px;"><strong>Age: </strong>23-year-old </p>
	<p style="line-height:0.7em;"><strong>Age at start caregiving activities: </strong>16</p>


	<p style="line-height:0.7em;"><strong>Her background:</strong> </p>
	<p>Snoopey is 23 years  old and started caring for her mother at age 16. Snoopey’s mother has a number  of chronic physical problems that started with severe back problems and she is  now largely confined to the couch in the living room. Snoopey provides 24/7  care for her mother at home, helping her with baths, shopping, cooking,  cleaning, and other household chores.&nbsp;</p>
<div class="clear"></div>
	<p>Snoopey  is an only child and lives in an apartment with her mother. Her mother has been  sick off and on since Snoopey was very young, but when Snoopey was 16, she  started to need full-time care at home. Snoopey looks after all the household  chores and her mother’s personal care, except paying the bills and handing out  medication, which her mother  can do herself, although Snoopey delivers the rent checks and picks up  medications from the pharmacy. </p>
    <p>Snoopey’s  mother takes several medications for constant pain and other illnesses, and  spends most of her days and nights on a lazy-boy type chair as she is unable to  fully lie down. She can move around their apartment, but it is very difficult  for her to walk and they very rarely go outside together – once every three months or so to see the  doctor. Snoopey’s typical day begins around 3pm when she gets up and organizes breakfast  for herself and her mom. They spend the day mostly watching television with  Snoopey doing jobs here and there until the early hours of the morning when  they eventually go to bed. Her mother is able to be on her own for a few hours at  a time so Snoopey can go out to go to the store.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>Snoopey  and her mother have not had many positive experiences with the healthcare  system. For several years, her mother was in and out of hospital every few  months with multiple and different chronic problems, but she has managed at  home out of hospital for the last year. They don’t receive any help from family  as relationships are not very positive and with the exception of one neighbour who sometimes  helps, Snoopey manages everything on her own. When Snoopey was three years old, her father  left them, in part Snoopey thinks because he was unhappy and wanted a son.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Snoopey  is not able to work or go to school because of her caregiving responsibilities  and is sometimes lonely. Her day-to-day  life is not very typical of a young person her age so she finds it difficult to  find friends that understand her situation. She has found the youth caregivers  group in her neighbourhood to be very helpful – they discuss experiences,  feelings, helpful resources, and here she met her best friend who is also a  young caregiver. She wishes that she and her mom had more money to make their  lives a little easier, such as buying healthy foods and decent clothes. Snoopey  was told that she has a limited IQ and that it is unlikely she would ever be  able to live on her own and look after herself, but at the same time she knows  that she is managing rather well and doing a very good job looking after her  mom.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>She left her mom once to go on a trip with her  caregiving group but this was so difficult for both of them that Snoopey vows never  to leave her again. Snoopey feels frustrated by her situation sometimes although  caregiving has brought her closer to her mom and they have a very good  relationship. She also feels that being a caregiver has made her more aware of  her surroundings and she is more ready to offer a helping hand to others in  need. Snoopey would like the world to know that ‘gerbils – her favourite animal  - rule’! </p>
