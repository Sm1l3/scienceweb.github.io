	<p style="line-height:0.7em;"><strong>Her background:</strong> </p>
	<p>Susan  (58 years old) lives together with her husband, and has looked after her  parents over several years. Susan’s parents lived in BC and needed increasing levels  of care as they were dealing with different medical problems. After Susan’s father  died, Susan’s mother decided to move to an independent living retirement  community in the Maritimes, five  minutes away from her daughter. Susan has worked as a provincial director of  home care but took early retirement due to her own medical condition.
 </p>
<div class="clear"></div>
	<p>Susan’s caregiving  activities started when she was 45 years old. Her parents, who were living 3000  miles away at the time, were dealing with multiple medical problems. Susan’s involvement started  with increasingly frequent phone calls, however, she found that there were moments when she needed to go to  them as they could not be resolved by phone. Susan found herself constantly  deciding about whether or not and when to visit her parents or if she should sit  and wait. She made frequent visits (35) in this 15 year period. Susan, who was  working at that time, managed to combine the visits with her holidays, however, this meant that she  did not really have holidays to recuperate but instead continued taking on more  and more caregiving responsibilities. </p>
    <p>Susan later took early  retirement due to her own medical condition. In a strange way, she felt that this  freed her up to spend more time on the care for her parents and with respect to  the caregiving, it all worked out well. Eventually, six years ago, Susan’s  father passed away and her mother decided to move to the Maritimes to an  independent living retirement community to be closer to her daughter. Susan’s caregiver’s  tasks are mainly to socialize with her mother, help with grocery shopping and  support her mother in dealing with the medical system. Susan’s mother likes to  be as independent as possible and Susan supports her in that decision by trying  to fill in when her mother is unable to do things on her own. Susan says that sometimes  there is a fine line between when to decide to get directly involved and when  to remain on the encouraging side. To continue maintaining this fine balance is  one of her bigger challenges. </p>
  <p>In the time that Susan’s  father was still alive and her parents were living in BC, Susan consciously  chose not to be in contact with the healthcare professionals but to keep informed  through communications with her parents. This decision was in line with the thought  of supporting them in their independence although she found it sometimes difficult  to get the medical information she needed this way. Susan says that if she  would have to redo this period again she would probably be more proactive in  contacting healthcare professionals directly.</p>
  <p>Susan appreciates the support she receives from her  friends. She is able to discuss issues about caregiving with her friends and  they try to provide her with support and advice. Susan feels her friends are very  tolerant with her, even when she has not been able to remain in contact with  them as much as she would like. In fact, this is something Susan would like to  give as advice to friends and family: sometimes caregivers are consumed with  many responsibilities and,  therefore, unable to have  as frequent contact as usual with their friends. In those and other times, it  is greatly appreciated when friends are able to keep an open mind and have a tolerant  and supportive attitude towards the caregiver. </p>
