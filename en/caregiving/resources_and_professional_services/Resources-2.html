<h1>Resources</h1>

<p>Most of the caregivers we interviewed experienced a  point in time where they realized that they couldn&rsquo;t do everything alone and needed  support. Caregivers found different resources depending on their situation,  their needs and what services were available in their area. Several caregivers mentioned  that a centralized source of information would be useful, although no such  resource is available in most places. Sometimes, caregivers simply didn&rsquo;t know what  resources and support existed. In most areas of Canada, more could be done to  share information about current services and support in a way that caregivers  and their families find useful. </p>

<h2>Caregiver  support groups and disease specific organizations</h2>
<p>About half of the people we interviewed had joined  a caregivers&rsquo; support group. Generally this was valued as a good starting point  where they could receive information on caregiving and to get support.</p>

<p>Several caregivers had to look around for the right  support group. Richard said, &ldquo;I went to a couple of men&rsquo;s groups and eventually  the second one kind of stuck with me. It was not associated with a church and I  felt more comfortable in that. However nobody in that group was really involved  with a spouse who had a chronic illness. Eventually, I just was looking on the  internet for spousal caregivers, and by accident found the Well Spouse  Association.&rdquo; </p>

<p>For caregivers who go to work, it was particularly hard  to find a support group that facilitated events or activities for people who still have to work while caring. For example, in Rowdyneko&rsquo;s region,  the support group only provided courses in the daytime: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no recognition  at all for caregivers&rsquo; work, which is rather too bad because it&rsquo;s a total added  stress to carry when you are trying to work as well.&rdquo; Joanne, who is working  and caring as well, would rather do something else on her free evenings than  attend a support group.</p>
<p>Some people stopped attending support groups.  Sheni, for example, found great support from an online spousal support group. She  attended face-to-face meetings and still has contact with certain members of  the group. Although she visited the site less often once she got over her  initial excitement, she definitely thinks people should check out this resource  and sign-up; it was still very helpful at first.</p>

<p>Others became more involved in caregivers support  groups and even became leaders of groups themselves. </p>

<p>People valued support groups for different reasons.  In general, caregivers feel that other people didn&rsquo;t understand what they were  going through. At a support group, they appreciated speaking with people who  understood what they were going through. In addition, caregivers support groups  were able to provide people with information about resources, explain the emotions  that they may have, and in some cases gave courses. </p>

<h2>Grocery  and pharmacy delivery services</h2>
<p>Simple services can make a big difference. For  example, Claire said, &ldquo;So, I think it&rsquo;s about being creative and finding those  little spaces where you can find those moments.&rdquo; Claire and Luke came up with the  idea of having their groceries delivered or them ordering online, which saves them  a lot of time. Joseph used to pick up medications for his wife during work  hours and then bring them home in case of an emergency: &ldquo;We learned that the  pharmacy had a delivery service, but I had never thought about asking for this  service because I was doing it. I took upon myself to attend to all her needs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Transportation  services</h2>
<p>Several caregivers made use of door-to-door transportation  services. Sometimes they were run by volunteers and sometimes they were  professionally organized. </p>
<div class="purpleBox">
<a style="float:left;"><img src="../profile/100x100/images/00_audio.jpg" /></a>
	<div class="purpleBoxContainer">
		<div class="purpleBoxContent">

<p>Matsonia was told by the planning coordinator of  the Parkinson&rsquo;s society that she could apply for the door-to-door services for  her husband. Thanks to these services, her husband can go to an exercise class  while she takes a break for about two and a half hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The first time he  left with this service, she felt sick to her stomach with worry because she had  always done everything for him at home. </p>
<p>Alyce has insurance coverage to get a chauffeur to  take her husband places; this is a great help when it is cold and icy outside,  and the driver gives them a hand. </p>
<p>In Snoopey&rsquo;s  case, the door-to-door service once cancelled 24 hours before their appointment  even though she had booked three  weeks beforehand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Day  programs, respite and holidays</h2>
<p>Like Matsonia, there were other caregivers who made  use of day programs for their care recipient. Sheni&rsquo;s husband goes to a day program  on Mondays and Tuesdays. Sheni thinks it is good for him to get out and  socialize. Joanne&rsquo;s mother used to go to a day program but stopped because she  felt everybody there was old. </p>
<p>Some people arranged to have paid caregivers look  after the care recipient so they could have some time for themselves. Donovan  and his wife, for example, had made arrangements for people to come and help  out before they decided to have live-in-caregivers. Michael and Lillian&rsquo;s son  has always been in specialized schools and after school they had privately paid  caregivers. Now that he has turned 18, they will have to look into different  options for daytime care. </p>

<p>Many caregivers used paid care or respite services  to be able to take an overnight break or to go on holidays. Please visit the  page <a href="../personal_challenges/traveling_holidays.html">Travelling, holidays and respite </a>  if you like to read more about this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Home  adaptation and other resources</h2>
<p>Several caregivers had made home modifications they  found useful, such as a ceiling pole, railings, and a walk-in bathtub. Several  caregivers had received funding for these modifications through local or  government programs and had a specialist come to their home to advise them on  the appropriate changes. Others had made changes in the home themselves, such  as removing doors to make the home more accessible. Some caregivers decided to  move to a new home that was already adapted for their needs. </p>
<p>Several caregivers needed specialized equipment like  scooters, or elevators. Rachel&rsquo;s mother, for example, moved to a disability  suite that is partly funded by government and partly by a Christian charity.  David said, &ldquo;My wife has received a wheelchair free of charge, scooters free of  charge, car adaptations free of charge. So there are a lot of social programs  that are in place that people need to be aware of. And, I mean, nothing is perfect,  but those have been good things for her and for us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>You can read more about resources that support  caregivers and/or caregiving in specific topic pages. You can also visit our <a href="../links.html">Resource section</a>   to find links to other organizations and useful tools and services such as Tyze  (a caregiving planning tool) and Caring voice (a telephone service) to help you  with caregiving. In the topic page <a href="../being_a_caregiver/society_and_caregiving.html" target="_blank">Society and caregiving</a>  you can read more about how people  felt about the support services that exist for caregivers. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Health  services</h2>
<p>Several caregivers spoke about the impact of  caregiving on their mental health. Many caregivers have made use of counselling  services or have received help from social workers. You can read more about  this in the topic page <a href="../impact_on_the_caregiver/impact_on_health.html">Impact  on health</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Caring  for yourself</h2>
<p>In order to take good care of the care recipient,  most caregivers realized that they also had to take care for themselves. We  describe their experiences in the page <a href="../personal_challenges/caring_for_yourself.html">Caring for yourself</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
