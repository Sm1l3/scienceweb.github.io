<h1>Home care and live-in caregivers</h1>

<p>About half of the caregivers  we interviewed received support from publicly funded home care services on a  regular basis. Several caregivers had experience with temporary home care support.  Caregivers who didn&rsquo;t have home care either had cancelled the  service or felt that they didn&rsquo;t need this type of support yet. </p>
<p>Overall, caregivers were  grateful for the help, satisfied with the people that came to their homes, and happy  with the care they provided. There were some exceptions when caregivers  encountered someone less qualified. </p>
<div class="purpleBox">
	<a style="float:left;"><img src="../profile/100x100/images/00_audio.jpg" /></a>

<p>Caregivers identified  some specific advantages of having support from home care services. Claire says:  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s wonderful to have caregivers around, of course because I couldn&rsquo;t do  without them. I absolutely need the help or I&rsquo;d be completely burned out and  exhausted.&rdquo; Several caregivers acknowledged that they still had the care  recipient at home thanks to the home care support.</p>

<h2>New and untrained people from home  care</h2>
<p>The  difficulties caregivers experienced were mostly to do with certain system issues  in the provision of home care itself. The frequent change of home care staff  was often problematic,  for example. Val counted 48 different healthcare professionals that came to her  home. Several caregivers spoke about the time and energy needed to train all  the new people that came to their home. Kai,  for example, said, &ldquo;We never got the  same person. We would always get a different nurse. So having to explain the  situation twice: &lsquo;This is my dad this is what he&rsquo;s going through, this is what  we do for him, this is how he likes it done.&rsquo;&rdquo;  At the same time, it was often difficult for  the care recipients to adapt to the continuous changes.</p>

<p>Like  Ginny, several caregivers decided to either stop home care or not apply for it because they preferred to do it by themselves. Elaine said, &ldquo;But I remember what it was like with my mother and I don&rsquo;t want&mdash;and neither does my husband&mdash;to say &lsquo;You have to wait until three o&rsquo;clock this afternoon when the guy is coming to help you with your bath.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Lack of resources or time</h2>
<p>Several caregivers felt that home care organizations did not have enough resources to  meet all the needs in their community. This meant that they either didn&rsquo;t receive any home care at all or had to manage with  insufficient home care support and frequent cancellations at the last moment.</p>

<p>Ginny&rsquo;s mother qualified for 45 minutes of home care services per  day, but they had to wait a long time before the service was available. Ginny  felt is wasn&rsquo;t enough; she was worried  about having to leave her mother alone. Anne&rsquo;s husband has 45 minutes of care every day, but she says, &ldquo;They keep coming to  us and requesting that we drop the time that they&rsquo;ve given him. He&rsquo;s getting  weaker and weaker and, to me, he&rsquo;s going to need more and more help, not less  and less. But they continually come every year and try and claw back any time  that he already has. It&rsquo;s, &lsquo;Oh, you don&rsquo;t really need this do you?&rsquo; [&hellip;] but I&rsquo;m  appalled at that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Several other caregivers  felt they received sufficient support and were happy with the services  provided. </p>

<h2>Live-in caregivers and other solutions</h2>
<p>Live-in  caregivers are individuals who are qualified to provide care for children,  elderly persons or persons with disabilities in private homes without  supervision. Both Sheni and Donovan have experiences with employing live-in caregivers who lived in  their homes to support them in the day-to-day tasks.</p>
<div class="purpleBox">
	<a style="float:left;"><img src="../profile/100x100/04_Sheni.jpg" /></a>
	<div class="purpleBoxContainer">
		<div class="purpleBoxContent">
		Sheni found the live-in caregiver very helpful, especially since she could check-in with him at home during the day.
        </div>
		<a href="javascript:shadowPopup('',922,630, 'interviews/3.12_Home_care/11_homecare_sheni.html'); void(0);"><span style="font-size:14px"> »</span> Watch</a>

	<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>

<p>Sheni  found it scary to hire someone she didn&rsquo;t know: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very  disappointing. People think that you can just hire a caregiver and your life&rsquo;s going  to be perfect now. Well, it&rsquo;s not like that. You end up with issues. You still have a lot of  issues to deal with, and you&rsquo;re basically an employer so you have a lot of, I  guess, paperwork to deal with as well and it&rsquo;s difficult.&rdquo;  Both Sheni and  Donovan found it a challenge to manage live-in caregivers as employees.</p>

	<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>

<p>Donovan  was able to hire two live-in caregivers thanks to a provincial program that  provides caregivers with financial aid to arrange their own support services.  Rachel and Drew also made use of this program. Drew said, &ldquo;We have a brilliant program here in BC called CSIL,  and that&rsquo;s really, it&rsquo;s a self-directed model of care. We&rsquo;re able to  self-direct that funding to what we feel working with, naturally working with a  public case manager what we feel is going to be the best arrangement given the  circumstances. And so that&rsquo;s been a great&mdash;there&rsquo;s probably not a family caregiver out  there who wouldn&rsquo;t say the same thing that there could always be more funding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even  when home care works as it should, it remains a challenge to find the right  care and the right support. Claire finds home care services absolutely helpful  in supporting her in her role. She says, &ldquo;Having outside help&mdash;absolutely could not  do it without outside caregivers in the home for sure. That&rsquo;s probably been the  best and the most difficult part all wrapped up in one.&rdquo;</p>
