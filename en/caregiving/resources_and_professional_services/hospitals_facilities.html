<h1>Hospitals and facilities</h1>

<p>Most of the caregivers  (26 of 37) were living together at home with the care recipient. Six care  recipients of the interviewed people were in a long term care facility, and five  were in assisted living. Although most of the people we interviewed were caring  for their care recipient at home, many caregivers anticipated that there might  be a time in the future when the care recipient would have to go to a facility  where there would be more support. Some care recipients had gone through  transition periods, from hospital to interim care to a facility. Several  caregivers spoke about their experiences when their care recipient needed  hospital care, some positive and some negative experiences. Overall, caregivers  were able to point out areas where healthcare institutions could be doing  better with respect to quality of care for their care recipient and for the  caregiver.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Facility versus caring at home</h2>
<p>Some caregivers  indicated that there was a clear point when it was decided that it was better  for the care recipient to move to a long-term care facility or an independent living organization. For  example, Mrs Smith&rsquo;s mother moved to an independent living facility for safety reasons  when the Smiths had to go to Holland for a longer period to care for Mr. Smith&rsquo;s mother. Ginny&rsquo;s  mother moved out of the house when she started using a wheelchair as Ginny&rsquo;s  home was too small for a wheelchair. </p>
<p>Fernanda and Christine  both reached a limit in their own ability to continue caring for their mothers.  Fernanda says: &ldquo;I did one of the toughest things I&rsquo;ve had  to do. I went to the hospital and I said to them, &lsquo;Look, I just&hellip; I can&rsquo;t fight  anymore. I don&rsquo;t have the capabilities of helping her.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

		Christine realized she had to leave her mother&rsquo;s home to protect herself. When she left, her mother moved to a care facility.

<p>Although most  caregivers we interviewed cared for their care recipient at home, some felt  they were close to their own limits and had started thinking about a facility  as an alternative. It was a painful and difficult decision with the realization  that it was no longer possible to continue the care at home. At the same time, caregivers know that they  had to accept the process at some point. Donovan said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s [future placement  in a facility] very difficult for me to deal with, very difficult. I don&rsquo;t know  how I&rsquo;m going to deal with it down the road.&rdquo; Although Drew expects to feel  some guilt and maybe somewhat like a failure if ever he decides to send his  mother to a care facility, he said, &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m grounded enough to understand  that when the time&mdash;if it ever does come&mdash;where her needs surpass those that we  are able to provide at home, then I think we&rsquo;ll see it because, again, the  first and foremost priority in this situation is her, not me.&rdquo; </p>

<p>Worries about the  quality of care or the human aspect in facilities were an important reason for  several caregivers to reject the option of placement in a facility. Joanne and  Rachel&rsquo;s mother are both terrified of the idea of having to go to a facility.  Joanne said, &ldquo;If she was in some kind of residential facility, she&rsquo;d consider  it hell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alyce, Sheni, and Anne think  there is no other option for their husbands than to remain home. Sheni said, &ldquo;I  am looking after him basically because what other alternative is there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anne said, &ldquo;And there  was one point when he was not doing well at all and we thought he should go  into a home. And we had them come, and they assessed us. And all they said to  us was &lsquo;There&rsquo;s people in a lot worse shape than you. You can&rsquo;t get into a home.&rsquo;  And that was it. Like, I feel there&rsquo;s no support whatsoever to help people like  that.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Christiane didn&rsquo;t feel  ready to let her husband go to a facility: &ldquo;When he was hospitalized, they were  always telling me, they were seeing the state he was in: &lsquo;You can leave him  here if you want and we will take care of the placement.&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;Well, I am  not ready yet. And,&rdquo; I added, &lsquo;you are not ready for him either; you are not  able to control him when he has dementia.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Caregivers described  how they thought they would feel if ever their care recipient had to go to a  facility. They said that it would feel like they were abandoning the care  recipient, and expressed feelings of guilt and failure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Long term care</h2>
<p>Caregivers also saw  positive sides to having someone cared for in a facility. In a facility, they  expected their care recipient to feel less isolated and to participate in  social activities. Matsonia said, &ldquo;They tell me that when he does stay in full-time residential care,  that we&rsquo;ll actually have more fun because I&rsquo;ve never been a wife to him. I&rsquo;ve  always been a caregiver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ginny and Christiane  both described having more time on their hands since their care recipient moved  to a facility. They also felt that the care recipients were in a safe  environment.</p>
<p>Several caregivers experienced  negative incidents in facilities and felt a need to visit frequently to make  sure that everything was going well. Christiane, for example, had a challenging  time with the placement of her husband because there were many things happening  that she felt were unacceptable: she arrives to find her husband&rsquo;s room excessively  hot, he is regularly  dressed in clothes that are too warm, and he is not always included in the social activities. The  Smith&rsquo;s mother was in a private facility at the time of the interview, but they  too were not always satisfied with the care provided.</p>

<h2>Emergency visits and hospitalization</h2>
<p>Several caregivers had  experiences with hospitalization. Sometimes it was a onetime experience without  any significant consequences. However, several care recipients were frequently  admitted to the hospital for various reasons related to their illness. In  general, this was described as challenging and emotional periods. For example,  Sheni said, &ldquo;[My husband] ended up at the rehab centre for a few days before  again having to go back to the hospital with another emergency situation that  was caused by him choking on food and aspirating some food into his lungs. And  so, after that, he was at the hospital again for a few weeks and then back to  the rehab centre. And this went on and on. He was at the rehab centre for close  to a year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without  going into each issue specifically, we describe how the caregivers dealt with unsatisfying  issues they encountered in the hospital, and what they felt could be done about  it.</p>
<p>Fernanda  has gone through a 13 year period during which her mother has been hospitalized  frequently. Overall, she describes this experience as positive, but she  sometimes had to resolve some situations where her mother didn&rsquo;t receive the right care. In one case, her mother was in  unbearable pain but not receiving the right treatment. As soon as she understood  the situation, she called her husband. She said, &ldquo;After the nurse told me that, I phoned [my husband] and I said, &lsquo;You  better come here.&rsquo; And I just feel that after all these years of dealing with  hospitals, all these entire crises, I have found it amazing that when there&rsquo;s a  man present people take extra attention.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Daphne  had a particular challenging situation in a local hospital where her father was  receiving unsatisfactory care. In order to resolve some serious issues, she  requested several meetings with the hospital staff to discuss the situation. She  hired someone to help assist with the care at the hospital and she took  pictures to document what she saw. She considered suing the hospital, but  decided that that process would be far too draining.</p>

<p>The  Smiths had a very good experience in Holland where Mr. Smith&rsquo;s mother lived. In Holland, he said, the coordination of care  was excellent. He wished that in Canada there was one person responsible for  evaluations of Mrs. Smith&rsquo;s mother, like in Holland. He also spoke about the situation  in Canada for Mrs. Smith&rsquo;s mother: &ldquo;They take snapshots  basically, because there are so many different peoples involved. So you get snapshots and nobody really  has the whole picture. Luckily she fell a couple of times in the hospital and  that scared them a bit and that was a great help.&rdquo; </p>
