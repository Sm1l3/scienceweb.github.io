<h1>Interaction with professionals</h1>

<p>Most caregivers we interviewed accompanied their  care recipient to medical appointments and communicated regularly with healthcare  professionals about care, follow-up, and future decisions. The approach and  manner with which professionals interacted with the care recipient and the  caregiver often had a big impact in many caregivers&rsquo; lives and perspectives on  their relationship with professionals. Most caregivers had experienced positive  encounters with healthcare professionals, although most caregivers also  experienced negative encounters. Several caregivers had an experience with what  they felt was a misdiagnosis, wrong treatment, or they disagreed with the  approach of the healthcare professional. Several caregivers described how they  improved their interaction with professionals over time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Positive  experiences with professionals</h2>
<p>The majority of the caregivers we interviewed spoke  about a positive interaction with one or more healthcare professionals. In some  situations, caregivers continued to be extremely grateful about a professional  that helped them through a challenging moment. Fernanda said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had some  wonderful experiences in which this doctor, when I was at the end of my rope  not knowing how I was going to help my mother, and when he said, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s time. You&rsquo;ve  done your part. Now it&rsquo;s time for us to do our part.&rsquo; I mean, how do I ever,  ever, ever thank that doctor for what kindness he showed me?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="purpleBox">

<p>Caregivers who described positive experiences with  healthcare professionals appreciated those people who recognized that they  needed support too, understood the situation, were engaged and listened well, arranged  the right things with regards to the care, and provided the right information.</p>

<div class="clear"></div>

<p>Several caregivers talked about their appreciation  of key people within the healthcare system who had been particularly helpful. For example, Drew meets his GP when the clinic is closed: &ldquo;So the practical  reality of her condition is such that going to a GP&rsquo;s office is not an option.  We have a brilliant family physician who has moved three times since I&rsquo;ve been  my mother&rsquo;s guardian and we continue to see him even though he&rsquo;s three hours  away by car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Impact  on caregiver after negative encounters</h2>
<p>Although the majority of the caregivers had  positive experiences with healthcare professionals, there were also negative  incidents. And as David said, &ldquo;The problem with negative experiences is that  they linger on with you.&rdquo; Examples of negative encounters most frequently involved  doctors who lacked an understanding, painful or insensitive remarks from  healthcare professionals, or when healthcare professionals seemed to have  unrealistic expectations of what the caregivers should do. </p>

<h2>Disagreements  on diagnosis and treatment</h2>
<p>Several  caregivers had disagreements with health care professionals for different  reasons. In some cases, it was felt that the care recipient didn&rsquo;t receive the  right treatment or that the healthcare professional didn&rsquo;t believe or  acknowledge what care recipients or caregivers were saying. Caregivers also  sometimes felt that their care recipient needed something different from what  was offered or provided.</p>

<p>Dealing  with disagreements with healthcare professionals is challenging for most  caregivers. It sometimes caused anxiety, anger, frustration, and reduced trust.  Rachel said, &ldquo;The woman who works at the MS Society here in BC, who originally  diagnosed my mom with ALS, has never really gotten over, I think, the  misdiagnosis. She&rsquo;s always trying to prove my mom wrong in some way. So that  has been beyond frustrating.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Solutions</h2>
<p>The caregivers we interviewed had different approaches to deal with challenging encounters with healthcare professionals. Overall many caregivers tried to find ways to work together with the healthcare professionals to provide the best care for the care recipient. However, on several occasions, caregivers decided  not to argue with the healthcare professional even though they disagreed with their final decision. </p>
<div class="purpleBox">
	<a style="float:left;"><img src="../profile/100x100/14_Barbara.jpg" /></a>
	<div class="purpleBoxContainer">
		<div class="purpleBoxContent">

<p>If  caregivers had doubts about the care they received, they sometimes contacted another  health care professional for another opinion or further advice. Mrs Smith  called their doctor after having been dismissed from the emergency department: &ldquo;So  when I&rsquo;m describing everything to the doctor on the phone, and that&rsquo;s her  family doctor, he says to me, &lsquo;She&rsquo;s had a stroke. Take her back to [the  emergency department].&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

	<div class="clear"></div>

<div class="clear"></div>

<p>Sometimes it was helpful to bring visual &lsquo;evidence&rsquo;  of a situation to the professionals&rsquo; attention. Lillian and Michael took a  video of their son to be able to show the health care professional what they  thought were seizures. Daphne took pictures of her father&rsquo;s infection so she  could show it to his doctor. </p>
<div class="purpleBox">
	<a style="float:left;"><img src="../profile/100x100/31_Helene.jpg" /></a>
	<div class="purpleBoxContainer">
		<div class="purpleBoxContent">
        H&eacute;l&egrave;ne&rsquo;s husband asked the doctor to treat him not as  a number but as a person, and since then they get along really well.

<p>Most caregivers prepare well when they go to their  health care professional. Jacques, for example, has everything ready when he  meets the neurologist: &ldquo;When I get there, I have my daughter&rsquo;s annual report.  The whole year is there with all the remarks. I have been doing this for 10-15  years for sure. It is a big help and I think it is good advice for parents&mdash;when you go to the doctor, be prepared.&rdquo;</p>
