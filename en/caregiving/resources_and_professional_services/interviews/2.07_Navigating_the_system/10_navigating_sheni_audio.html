		<p>I was having a discussion with somebody  at one of the rehab centres about my husband living at home. He wasn&rsquo;t living here at that point in time, and they had a problem with me not having him here. So I had a discussion with them. He was attending a program down there&mdash;a rehabilitation program down there&mdash;and in order to get down there, you have to go from the suburbs to the city. And at that point in time, especially, he was in worse shape than he is now, and there&rsquo;s no way he could go down by himself.</p>
        <p>So, I said, &ldquo;Okay, look. If he was living  here at home and I&rsquo;m out working, how is he going to get to your program?&rdquo; And they said, &ldquo;Well, you know, you can try.&rdquo; They gave me a list of numbers to call to see if I could arrange something.Â Obviously he could have taken a taxi, but that would have cost about $150 a day; $75 each way. That is not something that the average family&mdash;you&rsquo;d have to be really, really well off in order to be able to afford that. That wasn&rsquo;t an option. So I started phoning all these places to see if I could arrange transportation down there, back and forth. Everyone I phoned said &ldquo;Oh  no, no. Oh you live there? No, we don&rsquo;t&rsquo; do that! Oh, no, no, we don&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>And so every number they gave me, I was running into a brick wall and I thought, &ldquo;How could you possibly give me those numbers and not know that they would not be able to provide the service that I specifically discussed with them.&rdquo; They&rsquo;re obviously not doing their job if they&rsquo;re giving this information to me and telling me to set something up with these people. What is wrong with a system that puts that burden on somebody and doesn&rsquo;t even do the research? They&rsquo;re implying that something&rsquo;s there. It&rsquo;s not there, and they&rsquo;re getting me to run this wild goose chase.</p>
