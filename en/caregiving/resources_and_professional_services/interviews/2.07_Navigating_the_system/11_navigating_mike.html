		<p>If you want your partner to get the best of care, you have to ruffle feathers. At some point in time, don&rsquo;t be afraid to ruffle and say, &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t accept this. This is wrong. You&rsquo;re doing it wrong.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Where I got into this with my wife quite a few years ago, we had her in the hospital in horrendous pain; we didn&rsquo;t know she had MS at the time. To make a long story short, they called me up to come down and take her home. And she&rsquo;s worse than when I brought her in. I said, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with her?&rdquo; and they said, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know. We&rsquo;re sending her home.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s worse now than when I brought her in. Why would I want to take her home? She can&rsquo;t even stand up, she&rsquo;s bowled over in pain.&rdquo; &ldquo;You have to take her home she&rsquo;s been discharged.&rdquo; I took the wheelchair, turned it around and walked right back to the emergency room and said, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s yours!&rdquo; and  had an argument with the doctor. &ldquo;What am I going to do, taking her home and she gets worse? Bring her back? I have 2 young children at home. I am not taking her home.&rdquo; I turned around and walked away. It wasn&rsquo;t easy, but I turned around and walked away.</p>
        <p>And that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m getting at; as a  caregiver you&rsquo;ve got to know when to stand. And men tend&mdash;again I&rsquo;m only giving a perspective here&mdash;men tend to stand up and say, &ldquo;No. This isn&rsquo;t the way it&rsquo;s going to be.&rdquo; And walk away. But your spouse or your partner has to know you&rsquo;re not walking away and leaving them, you&rsquo;re doing it because they need the help. And hopefully that answers your question.</p>
