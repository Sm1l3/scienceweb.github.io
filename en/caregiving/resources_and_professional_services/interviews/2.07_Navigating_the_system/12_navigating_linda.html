		<p>That&rsquo;s the hard part&mdash;when you send  someone, you&rsquo;re trusting another person to look after your husband for you and you&rsquo;re trusting them. And yet, I&rsquo;m saying don&rsquo;t trust them. Be on top of it. You have to know what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
        <p>The problem I was having with all the facilities [was] that they were not giving his pills on time right from the very first start in the morning. So, normally here at home, we start his meds at 7 o&rsquo;clock in the morning unless we have an early appointment somewhere, then maybe I&rsquo;ll start his pills at 6 or 6:30 in the morning and then every 2&frac12; hours after that. When I do start his pills at 6 am in the morning, it really does make for a short day for him, because it means his pills run out sooner so he&rsquo;s more apt to go to bed at 5 o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon. It also means I need to serve him supper a lot earlier as well.</p>
        <p>Anyway, when we&rsquo;re at [a residential care facility], we sat down and talked about it and it finally dawned on me. They said, &ldquo;Well the reason why we can&rsquo;t give him his 7 am pills is because we&rsquo;re doing our shift change. We&rsquo;re doing our night nurse/day nurse shift change at 7 am so that&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s not getting his pills until 7:30, 8-8:30 in the morning.&rdquo; Well, by then, then he was due for his pills again at 9:30. So I got  smart and I went to our other neurologist&mdash;we have one locally as well, because it&rsquo;s too hard to go to [the university hospital] every time there&rsquo;s a problem. So we also have a neurologist here and we just love him and he rewrote the prescription for me to say that he&rsquo;s  supposed to get his pills at 6 in the morning. So this way, the night nurse has to give him his pills at 6 am. She&rsquo;s got nothing else going on. She&rsquo;s not doing her shift change, so she can&rsquo;t get out of it. So this has worked like lucky charms. Even though I give him his pills at 7, but when he goes to these  facilities, they start his pills at 6. That&rsquo;s helped.</p>
        <p>Trial and error; you just have to get creative and foxy sometimes.</p>
