		<p>I learned this, not through the CLSC, by the [city&rsquo;s <u>Association des personnes aidantes</u>]. They told me, &ldquo;How come he doesn&rsquo;t have two partial baths. He should have two showers and two partial baths, at least in&mdash;between showers.&rdquo; Then I called them, &ldquo;Oh well, yeah, maybe! We will look up his case and&hellip; &rdquo; You are always, always, always&hellip; It is annoying, it is exhausting! He was in the hospital for five weeks, every morning I was making phones calls to try to find solutions for this, and for that. The CLSC, you saw how it works? Do you think this is a man who is interested in going shopping? To go for a stroll outside, to go out? To see other things? No. Once he was in the hospital and I brought him in his wheelchair to the exit. He tells me, &ldquo;Go by the news stand, I want to see the colors.&rdquo; Then I thought, &ldquo;So he might be interested if he didn&rsquo;t have to make the effort of walking because of his breathing and his Parkinson&rsquo;s.&rdquo; He couldn&rsquo;t have a wheelchair. I had to fight to get one.</p>
        <p>I demanded that he be seen by an occupational therapist, a physiotherapist, and a neurologist. Then they signed the papers and he had a wheelchair through the rehabilitation hospital, otherwise he wouldn&rsquo;t have had one. So, I was always fighting because they were telling me, &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t need it in the house.&rdquo; But look at the furniture in the house! He hangs on to the furniture, and when he doesn&rsquo;t hang on to the furniture, he hangs on to me. And thus, I was finally able to have a wheelchair.</p>
