		<p>For outside help or support from the CLSC, I would say you don&rsquo;t really know what&rsquo;s out there as far as help. You really have to have connections, or make tons of calls, or think of asking questions to the right people in order to get the services that you might need, and also services you might not even realize you need but are out there for you. I&rsquo;ve learned a lot in the last few years of those services, and I can even see an improvement in their services in the last 5 years. There&rsquo;s more out there, but you need to either have a professional who is knowledgeable of the services and [who] will tell you about them so you can investigate and acquire the services, or just go for it and ask and demand and request until you get as much help as you can get from them. We were able to get more help for our mother but not until the primary caregiver&mdash;which was me&mdash;was way past being able to be a caregiver.</p>
