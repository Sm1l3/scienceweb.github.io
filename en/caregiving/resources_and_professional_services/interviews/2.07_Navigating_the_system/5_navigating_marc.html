		<p>Every time I knocked  on the door, sometimes I knocked on the wrong door. [If} The person can't help  me, she will tell me. As a caregiver, I don't know what to tell you.  Personally, as I told you, I had physical problems, like anyone else. We solve  our problems. It is more with the depression that I had to navigate more. My  family doctor and a lot by myself, because of course, after many years you know  more easily where to knock and whom to ask.<br />
	    For example, since  September we're meeting with a pivot nurse. I didn't know what a pivot nurse  was. And a pivot nurse is person that has a magic wand. The one that we met,  thanks to her, we quickly had medical prescriptions, medical appointments and  specialized equipment. I find that it is extremely important to meet someone  like this. Knowing that it exists. I never met one  before.</p>
