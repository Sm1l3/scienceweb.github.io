		<p>I think probably a combination. I think when I have felt the need to receive assistance to get information, I&rsquo;ve received it out west during acute phases. And I think here, because I&rsquo;m in my own environment and because I&rsquo;m well versed in caregiving. I think I haven&rsquo;t asked for help, except for help or advice amongst my friends who are also professionals in healthcare. So, we always help each other on how to best assist our aging mothers usually.</p>
        <p>But there is, in this province, a Centre on Aging that actually has a caregiving library and sometimes caregiving modules and DVDs. So, there is actually a strong resource of caregiving information here.</p>
