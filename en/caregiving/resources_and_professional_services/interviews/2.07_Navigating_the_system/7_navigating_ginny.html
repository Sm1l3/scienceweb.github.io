		<p>The medical care, I can&rsquo;t complain about it because I do feel my mother has received what she needed. But, I also have a friend who&rsquo;s a nurse practitioner and I&rsquo;ll very often say to her, &ldquo;Would you come and have a look at mom?&rdquo; She was the one who commented that, when my mom&rsquo;s lips were getting dry, &ldquo;Put this on it,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;do this for her,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;ask at the hospital for this.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t have a medical background and it&rsquo;s so nice to have a friend who can look at my mom and say she needs this or she needs that. And my  nephew&rsquo;s wife is a nurse, has a nursing background. So when she comes to visit, she&rsquo;ll look at my mom&rsquo;s bed sore and she&rsquo;ll tell me about what to do about that. Or she&rsquo;ll go and talk to the nurses and ask. And you don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re crossing a line, or you don&rsquo;t know if you should be doing that, but it&rsquo;s my mom and you want to do whatever you can to make her more comfortable and to make these days as anxious free as possible.</p>
