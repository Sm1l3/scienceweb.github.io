		<p>You&rsquo;ve got to be a total advocate, I&rsquo;ll tell you, to be a caregiver. Mind you, I mean, I&rsquo;m sort of naturally an advocate. I can&rsquo;t help myself, but you do need to be. But not everyone is, because I watch some of the especially elderly caregivers and they haven&rsquo;t a clue what&rsquo;s going on. Like the other day, I intervened&mdash;oh, they love me down there&mdash;I intervened [for] this guy next to my husband who was going home.</p>
        <p>So they want him to go in [name of company] which is a private ambulance, but they don&rsquo;t tell him that it&rsquo;s going to cost him $80 cause he lives up here. And so I say to him while the nurse is telling him this, I say to him while she&rsquo;s there, &ldquo;this is going to cost $80,&rdquo; because she&rsquo;s not telling him. &ldquo;Well, this costs $80.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>And so, then there&rsquo;s an organization called [name organization]&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s&hellip; I think it&rsquo;s just on the Island&mdash;and they have vans and they drive you for free. They drive people who live in the rural areas into the hospital and back home and to doctors&rsquo; and specialists&rsquo; appointments, to dialysis, etc., for free. Actually my husband had a card on him because he&rsquo;s used it when I&rsquo;ve been working, and we gave this guy the card or gave it to the nurse and I said, &ldquo;Organize this because he doesn&rsquo;t have to pay for this.&rdquo; She wasn&rsquo;t that amused. But actually, once she phoned [voluntary organization] and found out about it, then she was quite happy because it was another resource she had that she didn&rsquo;t  know about. </p>
