		<p>I know most caregivers feel a lot more negative emotions than people would think. Often outsiders will look at a situation and they&rsquo;ll feel very sorry for the person who is ill or disabled, and understandably, but they often don&rsquo;t see the impact on the caregiver as well. And when we took that course at the MS Society, one of the questions the  [&hellip;] facilitator asked was &ldquo;What was the one emotion that comes to mind when you think of yourself as a caregiver?&rdquo; And she was anticipating positive emotions like  caring, loving, and I don&rsquo;t know what&mdash;those sorts of things. And to a person, everybody in the room, and there was about maybe 15 of us there, the emotions were all negative: frustration, anger, depression, whatever. They were all  negative. And it surprised me that that surprised her, because she was a psychologist or a psychiatrist, I can&rsquo;t remember which. So it surprised me that she was expecting more things about &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so grateful that I can do this for my husband&rdquo; or whatever. I don&rsquo;t know what she was expecting, but she wasn&rsquo;t getting it.</p>
        <p>And that&rsquo;s one of the reasons that the  caregiver support group is so valuable.Â And if anybody who is a caregiver and isn&rsquo;t in a support group like that, I  strongly suggest that they find one or start one. Because if nothing else, it&rsquo;s just other people who understand what you&rsquo;re going through and you can blurt out all the negative feelings that you&rsquo;re having at that time, frustrations or whatever, and feel that it&rsquo;s going to be understood. People aren&rsquo;t going to just kind of say, &ldquo;Well just imagine what your husband&rsquo;s going through, &ldquo; or that kind of thing, or &ldquo;Just be lucky the shoe&rsquo;s not on the other foot!&rdquo; or whatever  some of these responses might be.</p>
