		<p>Then I found out about a support group that meets once a month in [a town in BC], and that is sponsored by the  Caregivers Network Society here. So I started attending that. Thatâ€™s during the day, once a month. And I didn&rsquo;t find it very satisfying because nobody else in the group of about 10 people, were in the same situation that I am and have been providing total physical care 24/7. The other people there were people who maybe had their mother staying with them in a basement suite or something like that, and just providing general supervision and assistance with whatever. So, none of the people there were in my situation, so I couldn&rsquo;t relate to them and they couldn&rsquo;t relate to me. So after quite a while, I just thought this group is not&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t feel it was helping me very much. So I stopped going, and over the years I&rsquo;ve had a bit more counselling.</p>
