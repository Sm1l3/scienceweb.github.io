		<p><strong>PART 1</strong></p>
        <p>Just a sensitivity to the caregivers, to  acknowledge them, and maybe provide also some services. Like for example, some support groups. I can&rsquo;t believe that nobody has thought of this. Support groups for caregivers in a hospital setting. You put a social work student, or I shouldn&rsquo;t say a student because it still requires skills, somebody trained in group work.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>PART 2</strong></p>
        <p>And maybe the whole issue of support groups, I keep going to that, it just seems to me so obvious and yet so  lacking.</p>
        <P>&nbsp;</P>
        <p><strong>Have you been looking for support groups? Have you been connected with a support group?</strong></p>
        <p>To my knowledge they are not in existence, but I think if there were, I would probably participate.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>And would you like to have it from a hospital structure? Or could it also be a caregivers&rsquo; organization that provides support groups?</strong></p>
        <p>I don&rsquo;t really care where they would  originate. I don&rsquo;t really trust hospitals with that kind of situation because they just don&rsquo;t understand. I feel they don&rsquo;t understand. So why would they create something when they don&rsquo;t intuit the need for such a thing. So it might eventually have to be based independently, or be based in CLSCs, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
