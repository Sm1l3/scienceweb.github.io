		<p>The thing I found most helpful has been support groups, and classes, and courses in all kinds of things; in grieving, in anger, in dealing with somebody with dementia, and what to expect when you&rsquo;re going to put somebody into a care facility, what you&rsquo;re going to go through, what grieving you&rsquo;re going to go through, but where your best decisions are, and the warnings about what kind of emotions you&rsquo;re going to feel so you&rsquo;re not blindsided by suddenly being hit with huge amounts of guilt. It&rsquo;s so much better when somebody says, &ldquo;You are going to feel guilty. But you will learn to accept that. Now you&rsquo;ve turned over the care. Now you can be a daughter or a wife and somebody else can do the care.&rdquo; Whereas when you&rsquo;re so tied up in the care, you&rsquo;re no longer being the very necessary daughter or wife that people need to surround themselves with.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>How did you find out about those sources? How did you go about looking for help and support or information?</strong></p>
        <p>Well, I heard about Family Caregivers Network fairly early in the caregiving. And I believe it was through a social worker or a doctor. Somebody mentioned it to me, and so I started getting involved with them then and taking courses. And I remember my amazement at the first course I took. [It] was on Coping with Grief and Anger, or identifying what&rsquo;s grief and what&rsquo;s anger and some, course like that. And I wasn&rsquo;t a big person on self-help and courses and stuff, and a lot of people aren&rsquo;t; people don&rsquo;t find it easy to ask for help. But that was the first one I took and I was amazed at what it did for me. And so, I just stayed involved in Family Caregivers Network from then on.</p>
