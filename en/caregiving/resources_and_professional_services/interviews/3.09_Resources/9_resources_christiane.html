		<p>So with the meals, I don&rsquo;t know if other  cities have this. [The city&rsquo;s] association des personnes aidantes. I don&rsquo;t know if there is a caregivers&rsquo; association [of another city]. I don&rsquo;t know if that exists in other cities, but they gave me a helping hand. Like when I have an outing with them, they pay for the sitter. So, I told them, &ldquo;Register me to all the conferences, I&rsquo;ll attend them all. I have to get out of the house, because it&rsquo;s too hard Physically andÂ  morally.&rdquo; Because you look at it and you don&rsquo;t recognize it. And with me  sometimes there are reactions, he&rsquo;s angry, he&rsquo;s sulky, he doesn&rsquo;t do that with others, but with me.</p>
        <p>And with the caregiver&rsquo;s association of [the city], well, I have conferences, classes that they give, they pay for the sitter, so that gets me out of the house a little. And then, they organize evening or lunches or&hellip; It gets you out of the house, and there with the others, I have a respite of eight hours, it costs me $15. There comes a young man who takes care of my husband. I go, and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
