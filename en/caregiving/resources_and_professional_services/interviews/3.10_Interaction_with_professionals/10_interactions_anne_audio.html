		<p>One of the problems I have, too, with his condition is his pain is getting worse and worse. And we get no support even from the doctors because they say a lot of the pain killers are addictive and they don&rsquo;t want him on them, which I don&rsquo;t understand because, if you&rsquo;re in that bad of pain, just to suffer constantly is insane. Who cares if he gets addicted if he&rsquo;s got some kind of comfort? But, I mean, he&rsquo;s in terrible pain at times. I don&rsquo;t understand that at all. I&rsquo;ve gone to his doctor and got really mad at his doctor and said, &ldquo;Why won&rsquo;t you give him anything?&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s got an addictive personality and na, na, na, na.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t understand it. Why they would allow somebody to  suffer as much as he&rsquo;s been suffering in the last while, it makes no sense to me.</p>
        <P>&nbsp;</P>
        <p><strong>Can you describe how that feels when you are there as a caregiver in that position and you feel you don&rsquo;t get any help?</strong></p>
        <p>Oh angry. Angry, frustrated. I mean, I went in and screamed at his doctor&mdash;my husband got really mad at me. I just got so frustrated with the lack of care. They just didn&rsquo;t care. It&rsquo;s a lost cause as far as they&rsquo;re concerned. They put no effort in, they don&rsquo;t have any help. I just get so fed up with them. And so now when I go to the doctor&rsquo;s, I won&rsquo;t even go in with him to see his doctor he makes me so angry. I just sit in the waiting room because I know I&rsquo;m going to be negative. So he doesn&rsquo;t, my husband doesn&rsquo;t like that. So, I don&rsquo;t even go in; I just get too frustrated with them. And there&rsquo;s nothing you can do about it. There&rsquo;s no point in even getting angry at them because it doesn&rsquo;t do anything. It does nothing. I find that really frustrating.</p>
