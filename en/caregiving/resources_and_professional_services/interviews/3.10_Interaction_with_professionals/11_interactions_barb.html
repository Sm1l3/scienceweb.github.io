		<p>I remember when my dad was diagnosed&mdash;and I sort of knew he was having seizures because he had had a couple of small accidents where he had seemed very confused, and I didn&rsquo;t know anything about a seizure disorder that wouldn&rsquo;t show up on a brain scan, that wasn&rsquo;t like  epilepsy and obvious. And I remember the doctor, and he diagnosed dad with a number of things&mdash;congestive heart failure, and so on&mdash;but he was okay to drive. And I&rsquo;m &ldquo;But he&rsquo;s having the seizures,&rdquo; and I remember him turning, like spinning on his heel, looking at me and saying, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go away and leave the man alone!&rdquo; And I went, &ldquo;Oh, okay.&rdquo; And about a week later he had that major seizure behind the wheel of a car that just about killed him and my mother. And I had that type of thing happen to me on occasion. Generally, I&rsquo;ve had respect from the doctors that I deal with, but I think I earn it.</p>
