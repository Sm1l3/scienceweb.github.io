It&rsquo;s me who  discovered that! Through talking, like word of mouth, you know. And when I spoke to her about it, she said, &ldquo;Ah! I wasn&rsquo;t aware of that!&rdquo; So, I did the follow-up, I searched, I called, and in the end I learned that yes, it existed. So, I called her boss, and I told her, &ldquo;Yes, it does exist, this is what has to be done, and no more problems.&rdquo; So she calls me back and was not in a good mood. She said, &ldquo;You went above my head.&rdquo; &ldquo;Because you didn&rsquo;t have an answer to give me, I had to find the answers.&rdquo; So I told her, &ldquo;I got my answers.&rdquo; Well, she said, &ldquo;I will hire you as a resource person.&rdquo; But for me, that wasn&rsquo;t a compliment that she was making, because me, I had the strength to do it, but my  sister-in-law, she wouldn&rsquo;t have the strength to do it. </p>
