		<p>The first doctor, in fact at first, my husband was not at ease with him; he didn&rsquo;t really like him; thought he was too cold. And he went to him and spoke to him and said, &ldquo;Look, I&rsquo;m not patient #1235. I am a person; I am not a statistics. So, I would like you to treat me as a person.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>He said that?</strong></p>
        <p>But he said that very nicely [&hellip;] and he  said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re very good, but this is not what I need right now.&rdquo; And you know what? Now they meet, they have their own signals that only them know and their own private jokes, and once in a blue moon I show up and just like 2 little kids really. But that too you have to learn to speak for&hellip; you have to be your own advocate, as the caregiver and as the patient.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>And have you had generally great interactions as a caregiver too with healthcare professionals?</strong></p>
        <p>Yes, yes. They appreciate that I&rsquo;m there.  They know me by now anyways. They know I come in with my blue book. There has been times where, &ldquo;Ah non, je n&rsquo;ai pas mal,&rdquo; and I&rsquo;m looking at the doctor going [shaking my head], because it depends your angle&mdash;you learn where to sit in the room. And then they will ask some more questions by them or they will say stuff. But talk to me indirectly so that I will know what to do.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>So you generally felt part of that scene?</strong></p>
        <p>Oh definitely, definitely. And a lot of them have given us their e-mail address so we can communicate directly that way. Others, it&rsquo;s a phone number and we&rsquo;re in communication right away. It&rsquo;s amazing. It&rsquo;s really amazing. And well, everybody&rsquo;s been really, really incredible.</p>
