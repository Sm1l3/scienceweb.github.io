		<p>I think every youth caregiver has their difficult moments with the medical, like the doctors and hospitals.</p>
        <p>I understand that the home healthcare network is under a lot of stress and I respect that, but I think when you come into somebody&rsquo;s space there has to be tremendous respect. Especially&hellip; and again, it&rsquo;s really hard to know when you&rsquo;re coming into a place where there&rsquo;s a youth caregiver, because youth caregivers, there&rsquo;s no mark on us [&hellip;]. We are an invisible minority in the mainstream Canadian society. But when you do come into somebody&rsquo;s home and you know that there&rsquo;s going to be youth, like you just treat it as respectfully as possible, and if possible get to know your patient&mdash;their likes or dislikes like I just mentioned&mdash;like, how they like a procedure done because they&rsquo;ve already had it done probably several times before you&rsquo;ve come. So, get to know how they like things to be done.</p>
