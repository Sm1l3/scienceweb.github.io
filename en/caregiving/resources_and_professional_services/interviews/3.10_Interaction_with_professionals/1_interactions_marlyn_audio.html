       <p>The doctor started telling me I had to start taking holidays myself. I couldn&rsquo;t be thinking about not doing it because I felt guilty or because it was difficult. And the longer a holiday that I take, the more work and preparation and arrangements I have to set in place in order to go away. But the doctor made a point of saying &ldquo;You need to get away at least every three months.&rdquo; And that was good to hear because I came back and I said to my husband, &ldquo;I have to get away every three months.&rdquo; And he was, &ldquo;Oh,  that much? That often?&rdquo; And I kind of thought, &ldquo;Ooh&rdquo;&mdash;guilty. But the fact that it had come from the doctor made me more able to say it without feeling too guilty about it. And I really came to believe that in order to survive this, and not kind of throw up my hands and say, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t deal with this anymore,&rdquo; I had to be able to do some of the things that I really wanted to do and wasn&rsquo;t able to do with him anymore. So, I&rsquo;ve started going off on some other trips&mdash;not just visiting my kids but&hellip; I went with my brother on a couple of short trips in the past couple of years down south in the winter&mdash;just to get away in the winter and just to try and do something that felt normal.</p>
