		<p>They wanted us to do things like&mdash;we never got to this point okay&mdash;but when we&rsquo;re having this discussion about whether I can care for him at home, one of the things they&rsquo;re wanting is, &ldquo;Well, he has to go get intravenous from time to time, okay?&rdquo; So, when we&rsquo;re having this discussion about whether he can come home, &ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;d have to come and have intravenous.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Okay, so how do we do that?&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, you have to drive him to daycare&rdquo;, 45 minutes! This very sick person. Then he has his intravenous. Then you drive him home, and then you drive him back later in the day because he has to have it twice. That&rsquo;s not going to work. How&rsquo;s that going to work? Take a look at this guy. Or then he sometimes has to have blood transfusions  because&mdash;I&rsquo;m not sure why&mdash;they think he&rsquo;s bleeding somewhere but they can&rsquo;t  figure it out&hellip; well, they can&rsquo;t do the tests to figure it out. &ldquo;So, blood  transfusions,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Okay. So how does he get the blood transfusions if he&rsquo;s not admitted in hospital?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, you drive him down to daycare in [city in BC] and we give him a blood transfusion for 4-5 hours, depending how many units he needs, and then you take him home.&rdquo; And I&rsquo;m like, &ldquo;Oh yeah, that&rsquo;s going to workâ€¦&rdquo; So then, one doctor says to me, &ldquo;Well, maybe you need to move to [city in BC].&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Sure, I&rsquo;ll get right on it.&rdquo; And that&rsquo;s one of the issues of living  here.</p>
