		<p>We were at a hospital and I was assisting&mdash;I was sitting-in in a meeting with a nurse&mdash;and I had a cup of coffee for myself and my wife in one hand and I had something else in another hand and I got up to help my wife get up from the chair and told my wife, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t grab your hand because my hands are full.&rdquo; And the helping person who was there and the medical person said to me, &ldquo;Ah you men, you cannot multitask as we do.&rdquo; And I didn&rsquo;t really appreciate that. Considering that the night before I had been up maybe a couple of times because my wife had fallen. And I just thought it was totally uncalled for. Now, this is one small detail and, of course, as you get more and more tired one becomes more vulnerable. So, I don&rsquo;t want to blow this out of proportion. This is just like one incident out of dozens of more positive experiences. But just, the feeling I have is that caregivers are just not, we&rsquo;re just not that important; we&rsquo;re an invisible minority. And so, if I can help give a voice to this invisible minority, then so be it. </p>
