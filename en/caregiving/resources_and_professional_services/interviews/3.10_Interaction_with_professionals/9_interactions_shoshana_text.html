		<p>The doctor we dealt with when my husband was first diagnosed, he gave my husband a name of [a diagnosis called neuritis] that he could say he had, and I felt that he was wrong. And I confronted the doctor, and the doctor said &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go into it with you without him.&rdquo; And I  was concerned that it was something worse than what he was describing as an illness. So, he said &ldquo;Then, I have to meet with both of you.&rdquo; So, he told us that he believed it was MS, and the reason why he didn&rsquo;t tell my husband that was because of what he thought his reaction would be. And he was right. It&rsquo;s almost an instant reaction. He&rsquo;s going to go downhill quickly. He&rsquo;s been diagnosed with this chronic illness and it&rsquo;s going to affect a lot of things. And he was like that. When he got a cold, it was the MS. When he got a sore toe, it was the MS. It was all blamed on the illness no matter what it was, even though it wasn&rsquo;t related to the illness. So, I understood that part of it. That was just his regular doctor. </p>
