		<p>I mean, in my view that&rsquo;s a big stress off.Â  And again,  the social worker would sit me down and say, &ldquo;Well this is what you,&rdquo; to me, &ldquo;this is what you have to do; you have to move over here, you have to find a place to live, you have to figure out how to pay for it, you have to look after him 24 hours a day. You can&rsquo;t bring your dogs. You&rsquo;ve got to figure out somehow to look after your property while you&rsquo;re gone.&rdquo; Yeah right. So who&rsquo;s going to help me with this? And the bottom line is, if you don&rsquo;t have someone who will do all that stuff, you don&rsquo;t get a transplant. So, that pissed me off. The social worker  did not like me because, I mean, I challenged her on that. I said, &ldquo;You want all this done, and how am I supposed to do it? Who is going to care for the caregiver?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;What happens if I crash and burn in the middle of this?&rdquo; Oh no, no. You can&rsquo;t do that. Yeah. Just like this whole caregiving scenario. I mean, you can&rsquo;t crash and burn; there&rsquo;s no way to pick up the pieces. There is no support for caregivers.</p>
