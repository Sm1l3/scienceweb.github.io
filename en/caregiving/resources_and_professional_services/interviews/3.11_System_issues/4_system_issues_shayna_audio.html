		<p>As my husband deteriorated, we had had our first&mdash;his first car was a Grand Caravan and it was accessible but he drove; he could transfer. As he could no longer transfer, the car became obsolete. We couldn&rsquo;t afford&mdash;these are very expensive vehicles&mdash;we couldn&rsquo;t afford to get another one and nobody could figure out how to do it. [The  engineering company], in the end, cut his wheelchair in half with 40 ball bearings, put ball bearings on the driver&rsquo;s seat, it was just the base, so that he could pull up next to it and just move over and drive from it. It made such a difference in our life that he could still drive and I didn&rsquo;t have to do all the driving. It made such a difference to him, and it made such a difference to the government in that he was employed.</p>
        <p>What would we have done gone on disability? It is so short-sighted not to have these programs. You wind up needing mental health professionals, needing or going on disability or welfare. There is no reason if the only problem is getting where youâ€™re going in order to work on time. So, all these things are my pet peeves. All the things that I&rsquo;m mentioning. It&rsquo;s so important to see the bigger picture, the ripples. Again illness doesn&rsquo;t just affect the person, it doesn&rsquo;t just affect the family; it affects  everybody.</p>
