		<p>Well the doctor situation in town here now is really bad. A few years ago they had ten doctors and now they&rsquo;re down to three. And it&rsquo;s practically impossible to get an appointment. And a lot of people, they take advantage of a situation by going into emergency when it&rsquo;s not an emergency, and I won&rsquo;t do that. I won&rsquo;t do that so&hellip; But the doctor that we&rsquo;ve been going to since we quit the one up north, he&rsquo;s now retired. So, what do you do? There are three doctors there, and two of them are from South Africa, and one of them is from Cuba. So they don&rsquo;t really know western Canada lifestyles. I mean, their medical knowledge might be great, but they don&rsquo;t know a lot of causes and effects that would affect people and their health. </p>
        <p>So, to get an appointment with a doctor, well I haven&rsquo;t even tried. I have a situation here, I have to fill out a form for a disabled person and I have to have a doctor write three or four pages of stuff regarding it. Well, I don&rsquo;t know when or if I&rsquo;m ever going to be able to get it done. They wanted it in 30 days. Well, it&rsquo;s been about 15 days now. And so, I don&rsquo;t know if I can get the doctor to do anything. And if we don&rsquo;t go back to the doctor that&rsquo;s retired, the other doctors know nothing about my husband. Sure, they have the papers there at the clinic, but they&rsquo;d have to take an hour to read them before they finally figured out what he needed or something. And so, it&rsquo;s a problem. It&rsquo;s a real problem, yeah. So I rely mostly on myself to find out and do that which is the best thing to do.</p>
