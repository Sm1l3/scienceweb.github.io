		<p>Because if you travel to get medical care  not available in the area, it has to be 150 k&mdash;or whatever for example&mdash;and we&rsquo;re 10 km below. And I remember I wrote&mdash;like, you know how the CSSS for the region? [&hellip;] So, I have written them and I said, &ldquo;Well, this is pretty ridiculous,&rdquo; that when he had the operation for the tumour, I had to pay to stay at the cancer house because I had to be near there and I had to eat and we had to park, had to take a train actually because I don&rsquo;t drive in. All sorts of expenses that were our own. And [&hellip;] my sister actually is a nurse and said, &ldquo;Well, maybe you can get reimbursement for the train. Inform yourself.&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t even know I could have that. So, I write them they say no. So, I write back again and then I write&mdash;I start, I went crazy&mdash;I wrote the MP, provincial, federal, the  lot, everybody. I was like outraged. This is ridiculous. 10 km? I&rsquo;m going to move to [town in ON] and that&rsquo;s going to give me my 10 km. Come on, be reasonable people. And in the end, they reimbursed me for that.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>So  persistence pays off a little bit?</strong></p>
        <p>Yeah, but then I have been writing. I spent a long time the other&mdash;not this last election, the one before&mdash;I wrote every person in the federal that was <em>party  leader</em>, &ldquo;What are you going to do for me?&rdquo;/
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Any replies?</strong></p>
        <p>Some replied. Some never did. Some, I will write 10 times, they will never reply.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>And the ones that did reply was there  anything useful in their reply?</strong></p>
        <p>Yeah. Actually, it brought on that they are changing some of the compassionate care so that it can be&mdash;but that too I got help from the lady at the Canadian Cancer  Society. We prepared a lot of material, we prepared a lot of interviews. Actually, the Liberal party had come up with a caregiver plan, and they were quite receptive to it. But well, they didn&rsquo;t get there. But still, I had somewhere in there halfway through with the London story and with all that, I decided &ldquo;This is crazy. I&rsquo;m lucky. What is it when you&rsquo;re not?&rdquo;</p>
