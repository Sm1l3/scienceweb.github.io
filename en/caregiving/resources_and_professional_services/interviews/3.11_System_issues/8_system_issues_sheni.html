		<p>You can&rsquo;t live on&hellip; you can&rsquo;t raise a family on Canada Pension benefits that were something like $800 or $900 a month&mdash;whole family, okay? To live in a house, even if we lived in an apartment, you can&rsquo;t live on that little money. So, I obviously, I had to work and I said,  &ldquo;Well, okay. So, you want&hellip; you&rsquo;re suggesting that he lives here. How am I going to have him looked after while I&rsquo;m gone for work?&rdquo; Well, it turns out that they could provide 14 hours of care a week on different days. I&rsquo;m like, &ldquo;Well, I need 12 hours at least on like 5 days.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh well,&rdquo; like they just didn&rsquo;t have an answer for me. They had no answer for me. They basically insinuated that I should be the one to come up with a solution. They did not help me at all, and I&rsquo;m really miffed about that because they should understand. I don&rsquo;t understand how they can&rsquo;t understand this. Like, was I supposed to just not work and use the 14 hours a week a couple hours a day each day and then just look after him  myself and not work? I mean, that&rsquo;s not sustainable. It&rsquo;s not realistic. So, what I found with the so-called healthcare profession was that they had no answers; they had no answers at all for the financial aspect, which is a big aspect. Because if you have your financial base covered, your life is not nearly as stressful as if you don&rsquo;t. So, if a person that has an acquired&mdash;that becomes  disabled&mdash;worked for a company as a full-time employee and has long-term disability, then it&rsquo;s not an issue. They can&hellip; at least they have a decent income coming in. So, you can manage on&hellip; if your income&rsquo;s a bit lower than it was when you were working, well that&rsquo;s not too bad. But when you have no income, you just cannot look after a person in that situation; you can&rsquo;t. So, I found that they tried to make me think that it was possible, but didn&rsquo;t offer me any ways of making it possible. There was no financial help, there was no help from&mdash;there wasn&rsquo;t enough help from these agencies to enable somebody to work  full-time and look after a person in that condition.</p>
