        <p>No, they didn’t explain anything like  that. Of course, by the time you get to that point you’ve been doing  everything. So, there wasn’t much that they had to tell me. The relationships  with the caregivers themselves has been fantastic. The caregivers are really  wonderful people, and with the odd exception, we have just had amazing people. I  am so grateful to them because they’re not only doing things that I simply  couldn’t do—couldn’t be able, couldn’t bring myself to do with him—but they are  so cheerful and fun and funny, and I’m hearing laughing and jokes and all that  going on in the room with them when they’re here. And they have conversations  with him about sports things, what was happening in some game last night or  whatever. Or they’ll be telling stories or just making jokes.<br />
          <br />
          They are phenomenal. I can’t say enough  good about the people that they have in the system. Every now and then you get  a jerk, but by and large they are so much better than I thought they would be.  And I’m just eternally grateful, not only for the system, but for the people in  it. </p>
