		<p>I think there was lots that could have been done when my mother was living with me, but I didn&rsquo;t know about the supports or it took so long to get them. I remember making an appointment for someone to come to my house, and to get the caregiver to come to relieve me even when I was going to work, and so she came and she did some tests with my mom. And then she said, &ldquo;You  qualify for the 45 minutes,&rdquo; and it took so long for us to get that and then to  find somebody to be there. And then, when they found somebody to be there, I found that that person didn&rsquo;t come&mdash;it was somebody else who came, because they weren&rsquo;t the same person every day. It was just very, it was very difficult. It was very difficult to for me to have somebody new every day, because I had to, I was explaining every day what to do or where to find the sandwich in the fridge or how to help my mother, and I just found it very time consuming.Â I found that I might as well do it myself,  because it was&mdash;if I could have the same person or even just switch off one person, 2 people and both of them would take it. But I just found that it was just too difficult. And so in the end, it was either friends I counted on who  knew my mom or me. I still had a person come 3 days a week for my mom when I was&mdash;I tried to take on a part-time job. In my position, I couldn&rsquo;t have my full-time job anymore, but I could do something on contract. And so, I tried to have a caregiver come 3 times a week for an hour, but I paid for that myself. And even there, we got used to one person and then they changed, and then they changed again. So, that&rsquo;s really hard when you&rsquo;re used to one person. And I think my mom found it really hard too, because she never knew who was coming or what was happening.</p>
