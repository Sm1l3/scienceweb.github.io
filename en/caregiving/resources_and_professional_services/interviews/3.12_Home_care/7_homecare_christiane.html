		<p>Because I know that it helped speed up the number of hours&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s me, but I will tell you that yes, it&rsquo;s me&mdash;the number of hours of respite that they give. But did you see, the gentleman who was here earlier, he should be giving me two hours with the bath,  so I can go do the shopping, the grocery, the pharmacy, the cleaners, the bank, but they can&rsquo;t because he doesn&rsquo;t have the time. They are just three men in the area. They should have the possibility of hiring more help. Because, it&rsquo;s been one year since the month of July that I was with the CLSC, and I still don&rsquo;t have my respite hours in the daytime. I had them for a short time, because I found a employee myself, but he fell ill, so&hellip; a relapse of cancer, so he could  no longer give the bath, so he would give me a little respite. After that he started chemo, so he came here one day, and he was green. I said, &ldquo;No, we won&rsquo;t let you do this.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s the only time that I had respite, from him. He was paid by the CLSC, but it was me who found him. But if they advertised for that!</p>
