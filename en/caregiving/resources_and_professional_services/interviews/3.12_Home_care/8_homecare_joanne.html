		<p>But in terms of help in the home, that  establishment doesn&rsquo;t have any budget right now; they&rsquo;re not giving anything. So at home, there&rsquo;s no caregiver, there&rsquo;s no home support, there&rsquo;s no nothing. So, it&rsquo;s either me, or you pay. And to give you a concrete example of that is we&rsquo;re  still on a waiting list for some of those things and this week there was a phone call from someone from that establishment, who called my mom to say that there was a space for help with a shower once a week. And my mom said, &ldquo;No, no. My daughter does that for me.&rdquo; And I just wanted to scream because it was, &ldquo;Okay, maybe you don&rsquo;t feel that way, but think about me. That&rsquo;s one less thing to have to do, and it could be such a nice thing to have an extra shower and make your arthritis and your back feel relaxed.&ldquo; So this week, that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re at&mdash;this drama over the shower.</p>
        <p>So that really is frustrating because she doesn&rsquo;t see herself as needing help, and, I don&rsquo;t think, is really aware of my fatigue. So I took the risk this week in talking about that phone call with her after and saying, &ldquo;It would  be a good idea to say yes, because you could be sick, you could be sicker. You&rsquo;re walking now, but it might change. It&rsquo;s not a good idea to say no, and then that request gets cancelled and you have nothing.&rdquo;Â I said [&hellip;], &ldquo;I will help you with your showers, but when I come home from work, I&rsquo;m tired.&rdquo; I am tired. And she did not react to that very well. And that was very hurtful because I feel like hired help. Sometimes I feel like unpaid hired help. And I do it willingly. I&rsquo;m happy to help her and I&rsquo;m happy to have her around, but I don&rsquo;t see having people help as a negative thing and it will be more and more necessary as her medical situation changes, and I&rsquo;m really terrified of having to deal with that. Not so much that those things will be necessary, but her reaction to it&mdash;it&rsquo;s like walking on broken eggshells with her, and deep down, it makes me very angry, because I feel quite used and  neglected.</p>
