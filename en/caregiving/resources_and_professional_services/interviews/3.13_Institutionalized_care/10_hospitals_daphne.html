	  <p>They weren’t turning him. They wouldn’t feed him. They didn’t  put him on any special equipment. And lucky by the grace of God and my angel I  knew about all of this, because I had worked medicine and acute surgery. I  couldn’t believe that a small hospital didn’t have the appropriate equipment to  treat a stroke victim. Later after talking to other people in the hospital,  because it’s a small town you seem to get to know people who know people, and I  had lived there for most of my life, grew up and went to school there. You  started finding out that this hospital had a history. And if I had known this,  we probably would have shipped him out of there. But the people in the hospital  made you feel, and I hope people out there have maybe felt that too, that you  can’t do anything, that you can’t ship your person out of the place. All you  need to do is get an ambulance or a Handi thing, get a stretcher, whatever, and  get them to hell out of there. We didn’t do that. We talked about it a lot, about  transferring him down to another hospital that was bigger or even [city in AB].  I think going backwards if I had done it all over again I would have got him  out of [town in AB] and shipped him to [city in AB] to the [name of hospital] who  was a big hospital and had a neurological unit. When I asked for an assessment  down the road neurologically, this doctor, country doctor, didn’t seem to think  he needed it. When he was in [city in AB]  later on, I went to the neurological unit in [city  in AB] [hospital in AB] and I told them my dad’s story and she said, “What the  heck was going on there? Your dad should have come up here and had an  assessment and probably could have been treated and probably would not have  ended up with the deficits that he had.” Not saying how long he would have  lived after because of his age, and that sort of thing, but definitely would  have probably been treated with drugs.</p>
