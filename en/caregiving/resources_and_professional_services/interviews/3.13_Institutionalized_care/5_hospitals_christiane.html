He has some nice short sleeve shirts.  So, I had to hide his long sleeve shirts. And the tank tops, I hid them all.  Another day, I arrive and… I go to put his socks in the clothes hamper − winter pyjamas. He was  sleeping with long sleeve, winter pyjamas, flannel pants, and the top is in thick  cotton. But I said, “What this? What’s going on in their heads?” I have to call  them regularly. I spoke with them again this morning.<strong> </strong></p>
