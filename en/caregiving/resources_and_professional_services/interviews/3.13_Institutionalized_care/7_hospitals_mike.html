	  <p>If you want your partner to get the best of care, you have  to ruffle feathers. At some point in time don’t be afraid to ruffle and say,  “No, I don’t accept this. This is wrong. You’re doing it wrong.” <br />
	    <br />
	    Where I got into this with my wife quite a few years ago, we  had her in the hospital in horrendous pain; we didn’t know she had MS at the  time. To make a long story short, they called me up to come down and take her  home and she’s worse than when I brought her in. I said, “What’s wrong with  her?” and they said, “We don’t know, we’re sending her home.” I said, “She’s  worse now than when I brought her in. Why would I want to take her home? She  can’t even stand up she’s bowled over in pain”. “You have to take her home  she’s been discharged.” I took the wheelchair, turned it around and walked  right back to the emergency room and said, “She’s yours,” and had an argument  with the doctor. “What am I going to do, taking her home and she gets worse?  Bring her back? I have 2 young children at home. I am not taking her home.” I  turned around and walked away. It wasn’t easy, but I turned around and walked  away. <br />
	    <br />
      And that’s what I’m getting at; as a caregiver you’ve got  to know when to stand, and men tend—again I’m only giving a perspective  here—men tend to stand up and say, “No, this isn’t the way it’s going to be.”  And walk away. But your spouse or your partner has to know you’re not walking  away and leaving them, you’re doing it because they need the help and hopefully  that answers your question.</p>
